## Context
The concept was built around a coilgun from 2021. The requirement that broke it is not
velocity but velocity accuracy: the value proposition is a programmable per-satellite
ejection velocity with dispersion small against its astrodynamic effect.

> Amended 2026-08-05. That is a true reason and it is not the one that actually stopped the
> coilgun. The 2021-2025 notebooks give two, both about the payload rather than the launcher:
> the acceleration is enormous, and the electromagnetic environment is severe, and either defeats
> the point of carrying an unmodified CubeSat.
> [`../HISTORY.md`](../HISTORY.md#why-the-coilgun-was-actually-dropped) records the chain in the
> notebook's own words. The acceleration half is the table below. The EMI half has never been
> calculated in this project; E12 carries the gap.

## Decision
Ironless double-sided Halbach linear synchronous motor driving a reusable sled.

## Alternatives
- Coilgun (induction or reluctance). Rejected. ~~It needs a conductive armature, either bolted
 to the customer satellite, breaking the no-modification requirement (ADR-006), or separated as a
  sabot with its own release event;~~ struck 2026-08-05, see below; it offers no abort; and
  no published coilgun demonstrates velocity dispersion at the level this application needs.
  Its one advantage (very high velocity) is erased by the payload's own g-limit, which caps
  useful exit velocity near 26-35 m/s regardless of launcher.

  > Amended 2026-08-05. The armature clause was wrong, and my own other paper is what shows
  > it. It presented a false choice: armature bolted to the customer, or a sabot with its own
  > release event. There is a third option, and I adopted it myself in *Electromagnetic Launch
  > System for Vertical Silo-Based Missile Deployment*, an inductive cradle, a reusable
  > element the payload couples to and never carries, selected there over a conducting sabot
  > because it avoids rail ablation and suits repeated cycling. That is architecturally the same
  > move as this project's reusable sled.
  >
  > So "a coilgun must touch the payload" is false, and a reader who finds both papers, and
  > [`../SKILLS.md`](../SKILLS.md) points at both, can reasonably ask why VOLLEY rejected
  > coilguns for needing something the sibling paper shows they do not need.
  >
  > The decision is unaffected, because this was never the load-bearing argument. What
  > separates the two machines is control and acceleration, not where the conductor sits:
  > sequential coil triggering is fire-and-commit, a synchronous machine commands current against
  > a measured position, and Feng et al. run 1352 g mean against this design's 10.53 g. Those are
  > the reasons, and they are stated above and in the table below. The armature clause is struck
  > rather than rewritten because it was doing rhetorical work it could not support.

  > "Efficiency is 1-2 % in the literature" was wrong, and it was unsourced. Feng et al. (IJAE
  > 2025) report 14.9-19.9 % for a three-stage induction coilgun at 20 kg, the same order as
  > this design's own 20 % electrical-to-payload figure. Einat & Orbach (Sci. Rep. 2023) measure a
  > multi-stage reluctance launcher but at a 2.5 g projectile, five orders of magnitude below a
  > CubeSat, so it cannot settle the question at this scale either way. The efficiency argument is
  > withdrawn entirely, it was never load-bearing, and it was wrong.
  >
  > "Cannot command velocity closed-loop" overstated. Feng varies exit velocity 230 to 321.56
  > m/s by charging voltage, 10 to 16 kV, approximately linearly, and uses armature position/velocity

  > | | Feng et al. 2025 | This design |
  > |---|---|---|
  > | Payload interface | Aluminium armature coils on the payload | Magnets on a reusable sled; satellite untouched |
  > | Acceleration | 3.9 m barrel to 1352 g mean; >600 kN peak on 20 kg to ~3060 g | 9.2 g mean, 10.53 g peak |
  > | Energy per shot | 6.91 MJ | 2.85 kJ gross, 2.56 kJ net |
  >
  > A standard CubeSat qualifies to ~14 g quasi-static. Feng's design is ~100x that, and needs 2470x

> The decision it records, an LSM rather than a coilgun, does not depend on the withdrawn figure:

- Maglev-style rail. The 2021 framing left this open. Converged with the LSM choice.

## Consequences
Everything downstream follows from this decision, Halbach array, reusable sled, eddy
brake, supercapacitor bank, and the servo that makes the dispersion claim possible. It also
sets the ceiling: a synchronous machine's thrust is bounded by the same constant in both
directions, which is why arrest needs a separate mechanism (ADR-005).

## Validation
K<sub>t</sub> = 11.03 N per kA/m from `analysis/motor_model.py`. A1 has since run (2026-07-29,
rerun after the 2026-08-03 quadrature correction) and a meshed 2-D FEM agrees to 0.03 %, so
this is no longer analytic-against-analytic and no longer the weakest link; A1's verdict remains
PARTIAL on two field rows. Nothing has been measured, which is now the weakest link (E4).
The dispersion claim rests on E7's assumed sensor noise and needs A7. The drive that has to
deliver this K<sub>t</sub> is quantified in `analysis/drive_electrical.py`; its winding inductance
was unexamined until 2026-08-05 (P33).
