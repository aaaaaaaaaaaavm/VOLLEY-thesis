# ADR-016: Reconstruct the git history with labelled dates

Status: Accepted, Date: 2026-07-29, Phase: I

## Context
The project began 22 March 2021; the repository was created 23 July 2026. The commit graph
showed one week of work on a five-year project, and three CAD generations appeared in a single
import commit.

## Decision
Reconstruct commits at documented design periods, and label the reconstruction in three
places: `HISTORY.md`, the commit messages, and git's own metadata, author dates carry the
design periods, committer dates all read 2026-07-29.

## Alternatives
- Backdate silently. Rejected. GitHub exposes repository creation and push times, so it is
  detectable; and in a repository whose entire argument is auditability, an unlabelled
  fabricated timeline would discredit everything else in it.
- Tags and a timeline document only, no commit reconstruction. Safest, and rejected as
  insufficiently informative, the commit graph would still show one week.
- Leave it. Rejected: the five-year span is real and invisible.

## Consequences
The span is visible and the reconstruction is undeniable from `git log --format='%ad | %cd'`.
Four of six milestone dates are approximate and say so, `cad/CHANGELOG_CAD.md` states
Gen1's build history was never reconstructed, so inventing precision it disclaims would have
been the exact failure this project logs against itself.

Gen1's placement after the motor decision is inferred from the artifacts: its files
contain a stator, which a coilgun has not, and `HISTORY.md` says so and defers to the CAD
changelog if the inference is wrong.

## Validation
Tree hash byte-identical before and after (`1435acc`), and 37 commits preserved. Content did
not change, only history.
