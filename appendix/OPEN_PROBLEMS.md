# Open problems, known errors, and the fix list

Two categories: **P-items are errors in the currently published paper** and should be
fixed first. **E-items are genuinely unsolved engineering.**

> ## How to read the counts
>
> **99 numbered entries, of which 40 are live.** Every entry carries a `Status:` line written by

> | `CORRECTED` | **29** | found, fixed and propagated — **retained as the published record, not as debt** |
> | `CLOSED` | **30** | resolved, with the closer named in the entry |
>
> **Four of those moves are a classifier repair, not new engineering.** `\bRESOLVED\b` matched

## Lethality ranking — confirmed 2026-08-10

**Ordered by how likely each live entry is to be design-fatal**, not by ID, date, or the
HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW severity already carried in each entry. Those severities rank *how wrong a
published number is*; this ranks *how likely the machine is not worth building*. The two orders
are different, and neither replaces the other.

**Nothing below is deleted, renumbered, or reworded.** This section only orders what already
exists, and the entries it points at remain the authority on their own content.

**Confirmed by the author on 2026-08-10**, including the two places where it disagrees with the
register's own severity labels.

### The five most likely to be design-fatal

| # | Entry | The failure it would cause | What would settle it either way |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | **E30** | Below **r = 0.99326** per element per cycle, the machine delivers less total mission value than a spring dispenser — nine of thirteen elements forfeit the remaining manifest where a spring forfeits one satellite. The product then has no reason to exist | **Cycle-life test of the escapement, retention gate and sled** to twelve cycles with margin, giving a measured per-element reliability. This is metal, not computation |
| **2** | **E4** | Every number in the repository descends from a field model checked only analytic-against-analytic. If the measured thrust constant departs materially from 11.03 N per kA/m, the design point, the velocity, the lifetime multiplier and the comparison against a spring all move together | **B-1** — a gaussmeter and eight magnetised blocks, ₹22,000, method and bill of materials already written in `docs/B1_ORDER.md`. Unordered |
| **3** | **E33** | The residual dipole from magnet tolerance saturates a 15 N·m·s wheel in **3.0–7.5 days with the machine idle**. Combined with **E31**, a host that has lost attitude authority may not legally deploy, so the campaign ends before the manifest does | **Measure the moment and axis of each block on receipt** and compute the assembled residual, rather than assuming the Monte-Carlo tolerance distribution. The same instrument B-1 buys |
| **4** | **E34** | The 200 g arrest puts **18.5 kN through the structure eleven times** while eleven satellites are still stowed. A stowed CubeSat is qualified to 25 g and launch random vibration, not to this. If it does not close, the arrest cap must fall, and the 50 g case needs 202 mm of run-out the envelope does not have | **A shock response spectrum at the cassette interface** for the 200 g arrest, against a stated payload shock qualification level |
| **5** | **E35** | The payload sits 20 mm from the array at **442× a magnetometer's full scale**, and soft-magnetic parts leave permanently magnetised. The claim that the satellite is never modified is therefore false as built, and that claim is the product | **Carry a longitudinal-separation layout into `cad/parameters.json` and recompute the field at the real payload station**, or write a magnetic-cleanliness limit into a payload interface document. Computation, not test |

### Where the rest sit

**Serious but not fatal — each has a known fix and the fix is affordable.** **P46** (K_t is
4.42 % high) moves the design point but not the architecture; **P28**, **P36**, **P37**, **P41**
and **P32** are design or analysis work with no result yet suggesting the machine cannot be
built; **E29** and **E31** compound E33 rather than standing alone; **E32** reduces to a written
inhibit.

**Bounded scope rather than viability.** **E9**, **P44** and **E28** narrow what the machine can
serve without threatening whether it works at all.

**Bookkeeping, provenance and hygiene.** **P10**, **P14**, **P19**, **P20**, **P33**, **P35**,
**P38**, **P39**, **E16**, **E18** and **E25** are records that disagree with each other or with
their sources. They matter for whether the repository can be trusted; none of them is a reason
the hardware would fail.

**Not engineering.** **E14** and **E15** are disclosure and funding.

### The disagreement this ranking has with the register's own severities

**E4 carries no severity label at all** and is ranked second here. **P34** is labelled HIGH and
does not appear in the top five, because a magnetometer-carrying payload being excluded bounds
the market rather than the machine — and **E35** may remove the constraint entirely. **P45** is
labelled LOW and is genuinely low. **Confirmed as written.** If it is revised later, the entries themselves are unchanged and this
section is the only thing that needs editing.

## P: Errors found while building this repo (paper does not match its own scripts)

> **STATUS (2026-07-23): P1, P4 all RESOLVED in `paper/paper.tex`.** Fixes, causes and
> before/after values are logged in `CHANGELOG.md` (entries P2-01, P2-04). The items are
> kept in full below for the audit record. Two related defects found in the process were
> also fixed: the F06 conjunction figure was regenerated at the rated velocity, and a
> stale `astro.py` docstring value was corrected, both logged in `CHANGELOG.md`.

### P1. Conjunction minimum is wrong AND not a robust quantity: HIGH PRIORITY
> **Status:** `CLOSED` — resolved; see the entry for what closed it

**RESOLVED 2026-07-23, see CHANGELOG.md P2-01.**
The paper states a 30-day minimum satellite-to-stage approach of **45.3 km**. That
figure was computed at **20.65 m/s**, the superseded operating point. At the paper's
own rated velocity of **20.37 m/s**, `analysis/astro.py` gives **4.6 km**.

Worse, the quantity is fragile. Sweeping ejection velocity:

| Î”v (m/s) | min approach (km) |
|---|---|
| 20.00 | 37.5 |
| 20.37 (rated) | **4.6** |
| 20.50 | 56.1 |
| 20.65 (paper's value) | 45.3 |
| 21.00 | 63.4 |

This is a near-resonant beat sample, not a design property. A ±2.5 % velocity change
moves it by more than an order of magnitude.

**Follow-up:** `validation/A6_conjunction_cara.md` specifies the quantitative version,
probability of collision via NASA's CARA tools, which integrates over the covariance
instead of sampling one geometry. The test is whether Pc stays stable across the velocity
sweep that moves minimum distance by an order of magnitude.

> **A6 ran 2026-07-31 in a reduced form and P1 stays open.** Without GMAT, CARA or
> Space-Track there is no real covariance, so a 2-D Pc was computed against `astro.py`'s own
> propagator with an assumed one. **The stability test came back void**: at 14 to 63 km miss
> distances against a hundreds-of-metres covariance, Pc underflows double precision, and a
> spread of zeros is not a number.
>
> **What the run found instead is better than what it was looking for.** Pc has a maximum over
> covariance scale — a covariance wide enough to reach a 14.5 km miss is too diffuse to put
> probability inside a 5 m disc — and that maximum is **3.7e-8, some 2700x below the 1e-4
> anyone would act on, for any covariance whatsoever.** So Pc is not *robust* where distance is
> fragile; it is **irrelevant**, bounded far below any action threshold.
>
> **This does not close P1**, because a bound is not a probability. It does say the paper's
> current position — the 9.9-day realignment period plus mandatory per-shot COLA, and no
> minimum-distance claim — is the right one, and is now supported rather than merely honest.

**Fix:** stop quoting a specific minimum distance as a safety result. Reframe around
what IS robust: the ~8.1-day phase realignment period, and the mitigation of disposing
of the host stage before the first realignment. State plainly that per-shot COLA is
mandatory because the approach geometry is sensitive to exact ejection velocity.

### P2. Peak current is stale: MEDIUM PRIORITY
> **Status:** `CLOSED` — resolved; see the entry for what closed it

**RESOLVED 2026-07-23, see CHANGELOG.md P2-02.**
Paper says **323 A**. That belongs to the superseded 130 kA/m point. At the rated
140 kA/m, `motor_model.py` gives **392 A**. Fix the paper, and check that the SiC
device derating discussion still holds at the higher current (it should, 96 V rail,
1200 V devices, but the current rating of the bridge and busbars needs restating).

### P3. Far-field stray values don't reproduce exactly: LOW PRIORITY
> **Status:** `CORRECTED` — found, fixed and propagated. Retained as the published record


> **QUANTIFIED 2026-08-05 by `analysis/far_field_sensitivity.py`.** P3's diagnosis was right and
> the size of it was not known. Sweeping `build_field(n_wave)` from 3 to 15 wavelengths against a
> converged reference:
>
> | Station | Deviation at the default n=7 (336 mm) | Converged |
> |---|---:|---:|
> | 10 mm | **0.64 %** | 22.688 mT |
> | 20 mm | 4.36 % | 4.290 mT |
> | 50 mm | **374 %** | 0.104 mT |
>
> **The 10 mm value is converged and the 50 mm value is not remotely.** At n=7 it is 0.49 mT
> against a converged 0.104, and it is still 16 % out at n=13. The paper's 1.0 mT corresponds to
> an array shorter than the CAD's 340 mm. **No 50 mm stray figure in this project should be
> cited**, including the 0.4 mT in `field_verification.json`, until the array length is set to
> the CAD value and the model converged.
>
> This needs no mesh: magpylib's Cuboid is an exact analytic solution for a uniformly magnetised
> block, so the field is already three-dimensional. What was missing was the convergence check.
**RESOLVED 2026-07-23, see CHANGELOG.md P2-03.**
Paper quotes 22.7 / 4.7 / 1.0 mT at 10 / 20 / 50 mm. `verify_field.py` reproduces
22.7 mT at 10 mm exactly but gives 4.3 and 0.4 mT at 20 and 50 mm. Likely sensitivity
to modelled array length (edge effects dominate the far field). The 10 mm value is the
one that sets the keep-out spec, so this is minor, but resolve it before anyone cites
the 20/50 mm numbers.

### P4. Brake fin temperature rise conflates per-shot with per-campaign: MEDIUM PRIORITY
> **Status:** `CLOSED` — resolved; see the entry for what closed it

**RESOLVED 2026-07-23, see CHANGELOG.md P2-04.**
The paper states the 0.86 kg copper fin sees "an adiabatic 37 K transient rise" **per
shot**, and later refers to "the adiabatic per-shot rises (0.3 K coil, 37 K fin)".

`analysis/sizing.py` gives 1008 J into 0.86 kg of copper = **3.0 K per shot**. The 37 K
figure is the *full 12-shot campaign* total if the fin never radiated between shots
(12 x 1008 J / 331 J/K = 36.5 K).

The design is therefore *less* thermally stressed than the paper claims, but the number
as written is wrong and internally inconsistent.

**Fix:** state 3.0 K per shot, and 37 K as a bounding campaign-adiabatic case that
radiation between shots relieves. Same correction applies to the coil: 0.28 K per shot,
3.3 K campaign.

## P: CAD reconciliation and packaging (found in the 2026-07-23 Fusion 360 CAD build)

> These arose when the parametric design was taken into CAD across nine Fusion documents.
> The CAD is authoritative for **geometry and fit only**; `analysis/*.py` remains
> authoritative for **mass and performance** until FEA closes the open items. All
> geometry values below are traceable to `cad/parameters.json`. **No number in
> `analysis/*.py` or `paper/paper.tex` has been changed** on the strength of the CAD.

### P5. CAD sled mass contradicts the parametric assumption: RESOLVED 2026-07-29
> **Status:** `CLOSED` — resolved; see the entry for what closed it

> **RESOLVED.** `motor_model.M_SLED` and `sizing.M_SLED` now carry the CAD-derived **9.445 kg**
> (P15), not the 4.86 kg parametric estimate. A4 ran, the drawn plate passed all three

Original item follows for the audit trail.

> **UPDATE 2026-07-28, A4 structural leg has RUN (CalculiX).** The as-drawn 6 mm plate
> passes every declared band: 0.0194 mm airgap closure against a 0.025 mm per-plate budget,
> 33.7 MPa against 587 allowable, first mode 3408 Hz against >200. So there is **no

> rule's ≥6.80 kg branch stands and the machine as it exists delivers **16.53 m/s**.
The first-pass Fusion sled (6 mm Ti-6Al-4V chassis, stiffness-driven by the ±0.05 mm gap
tolerance under 3.7 kN inter-array attraction — 2.69 kN since A12 — **no structural FEA behind it**) implies a
sled mass of **~7.50 kg**. `analysis/mass_properties.py` assumes **4.86 kg**, which
`motor_model.py` hard-codes as `M_SLED` and which sets the headline exit velocity. Both
are estimates (one CAD-geometric, one parametric-solid) and neither is FEA-verified. Do
not change the scripts until analysis A4 closes the chassis, specified with a
pre-declared decision rule in `validation/A4_sled_structural.md` (CalculiX or
Code_Aster, both free, both read `cad/step/gen3/EMOCD_Sled_Gen3.step`). Source:
`cad/parameters.json` (sled group, `PROVISIONAL_PENDING_FEA`).

### P6. Payload seating / orientation: RESOLVED (by CAD, 2026-07-23)
> **Status:** `CLOSED` — resolved; see the entry for what closed it

Resolved via the rail interface: the 3U payload now models the four CubeSat Design
Specification corner rails (8.5 mm, `cad/parameters.json` `payload_3u`), which fix seating
and orientation against the sled cradle. No further action.

### P7. Brake sits past the release point: geometry / ConOps — CLOSED 2026-08-10
> **Status:** `CLOSED` — resolved; see the entry for what closed it

The eddy brake occupies **x = 1530-1740 mm**, beyond the **1500 mm** satellite release
point, on an 1800 mm longeron. The sled runs on into the brake after the payload departs
consistent with the fire-then-arrest ConOps, but it forces the track and enclosure to
extend past release, which drives the envelope length (see P9). Source:
`cad/parameters.json` (brake, track).

**Closed 2026-08-10 by the Gen4 layout, geometrically.** `docs/GEN4_STATUS.md` moves release to
**s = 1200 mm** on a 900 mm acceleration stroke and puts brake-fin entry at **s = 1222 mm**, so
the release station sits **22 mm before** the fin reaches x = 1530 mm. The fin then occupies the
brake interval over 330 mm of sled travel, s = 1222 to 1552 mm. **The release-into-brake overlap
is gone, and it is gone without adding track length.** Recorded against **A16**, which computed
the Gen4 finite-stator thrust on this layout, and **P32**.

**The second half of this entry was never P7's to carry.** "It forces the track and enclosure to
extend past release, which drives the envelope length" is true and still true — Gen4 keeps the
track at 1800 mm and the brake at 1530–1740 mm. **That is the envelope problem, and the envelope
problem is P9**, which is a kill-criterion item with an owner decision attached. P7 asked whether
the *overlap* was a defect. It was, Gen4 resolves it, and nothing is gained by keeping a second
entry pointed at P9's problem.

> **What this close is worth, stated plainly.** Gen4 is a CAD configuration record and **has not
> been exported into this repository** — `GEN4_STATUS.md` says so in its own first paragraph, and
> the committed STEP, analyses and baseline remain the Gen3 record. So this closes a **geometry
> question against a geometry that is not yet committed**. It is closed because the layout
> resolves it and the layout is recorded, not because anything was measured. If the Gen4 export
> lands with a different release station, this reopens.

### P8. Exit velocity provisionally 17.88 m/s pending sled structural FEA: RESOLVED 2026-07-29
> **Status:** `CLOSED` — resolved; see the entry for what closed it

> **RESOLVED, and not at 17.88 m/s.** That figure came from the 7.50 kg CAD estimate. The
> CAD-derived mass is 9.445 kg, so the rated velocity is **16.537 m/s at 10.7 g**, now
> propagated into `analysis/`, `paper/paper.tex`, the figures and every front page. The
> machine is no longer acceleration-limited: at 10.7 g against a 25 g cap it is
> thrust-and-mass limited, which changes what recovering velocity means (mass or current,
> not stroke).

Original item follows for the audit trail.

If the CAD sled mass (P5) holds, exit velocity falls from the script's **20.37 m/s** to a
provisional **~17.88 m/s** (with acceleration ~12.5 g, efficiency ~24 %, recoil
~71.5 N·s, lifetime multiplier x1.68, all CAD-corrected and provisional). **These values
are NOT propagated into `analysis/*.py` or `paper/paper.tex`**; the scripts stay
authoritative until analysis A4 locks the sled mass (`validation/A4_sled_structural.md`,
which fixes in advance which of the two estimates wins at which mass). Do not hard-swap
20.37 to 17.88 anywhere. Source: 2026-07-23 CAD Master Plan; see README headline note.

### P9. Closed envelope exceeds ESPA Grande by ~44%: packaging / host — CLOSED 2026-08-10
> **Status:** `CLOSED` — resolved; see the entry for what closed it

The closed installed envelope is **1839x 530x 940 mm** (`cad/parameters.json`). The
1839 mm length exceeds ESPA Grande's ~1270 mm longest-dimension class by ~44%, because
the brake lives past the 1500 mm release point and the enclosure spans it. Owner decision
(cannot be made in code): re-scope the host to POEM / custom accommodation (the paper
already leans host-agnostic), or shorten the track / repackage the brake. This supersedes
the earlier 1825x 516x ~1030 mm figure; the height change (1030 to 940) exceeds what skin
thickness explains and is **flagged for re-verification** in `cad/parameters.json`.

> **CLOSED 2026-08-10 by [ADR-023](docs/adr/023-target-host-class.md): re-scope the host.** The
> target class is a restartable upper stage, kick stage or hosted platform — POEM class. **ESPA
> Grande envelope compliance is not a requirement of this design.** The ESPA *bolt pattern* stays
> as the mechanical interface; what is given up is compliance with a *port envelope*, which is a
> different thing — the deployer mounts on a stage, not in a port.
>
> **The alternative was priced first.** Overhead that is not acceleration zone is 539 mm and does
> not shrink, so fitting 1270 mm means a 731 mm accel zone, and velocity goes as √s:
>
> | | Accel zone | Exit velocity | Lifetime multiplier |
> |---|---:|---:|---:|
> | As designed | 1300 mm | **16.388 m/s** | ×1.62 |
> | Fit ESPA Grande | 731 mm | **12.286 m/s** (−25.0 %) | ×1.44 |
> | Fit, 150 mm repackaged | 881 mm | 13.495 m/s (−17.7 %) | ×1.49 |
>
> **Why re-scope rather than shorten.** ADR-002 put the host as a spent upper stage in 2023 and
> ADR-010 specified the interface host-agnostically; **the ESPA-Grande requirement was a leftover
> from an earlier framing that two accepted decisions had already contradicted.** Shortening
> spends 25 % of the number every product claim rests on, to enter a market this architecture was
> not designed for, and it barely touches the mass threat that is closest. The repackaging branch

> oversubscribed.
>
> **What this does not do, and it is the part that matters: it does not make kill criterion 2

### P10. Enclosure, radiator, and packaged avionics absent from the mass rollup: CORRECTED 2026-08-13
> **Status:** `CORRECTED` — found, fixed and propagated. Retained as the published record

The ninth document (`EMOCD_Enclosure`) adds 2 mm aluminium skins, a 1600x 200x 3 mm
radiator, and equipment bays for the supercapacitor bank, PPU, sequencer, and IMU. **None
have line items in `analysis/mass_properties.py`**, so the 72.3 kg dry-mass rollup is

Original item follows, kept for the audit trail.


`paper/archive/EMOCD_submission_uncorrected.pdf` is a build of the paper that still
carries all four P1, P4 values (323 A, 23 A/mm² at 140 kA/m, 37 K per shot, 45.3 km
conjunction minimum). Its filename says *submission*. If that is genuinely the version
that went to the conference, then P1, P4 are corrected **only in this repository** and the
version of record is still wrong, which is a different situation from the STATUS block
at the top of this file, and one that a corrigendum, not a git commit, has to fix.
**Confirm which build was submitted.** If it was the uncorrected one, decide between
withdrawing, submitting an erratum, or correcting at the camera-ready stage, and record
the outcome here. If the submitted build was in fact compiled from the corrected

### P12. The paper contradicts the CAD in two places: RESOLVED 2026-07-29
> **Status:** `CLOSED` — resolved; see the entry for what closed it

> **RESOLVED in `paper/paper.tex`.** The Limitations section no longer says masses derive

Original item follows for the audit trail.

Found while sweeping the repository for stale values. Both are prose claims, not computed
numbers, and neither has been changed in `paper/paper.tex`:

1. **Limitations (Sec. XV) says "Masses derive from a parametric solid model, not detailed
   CAD."** That was true when written and is now false, nine Fusion documents exist in
   `cad/`. The honest replacement is not "CAD exists" but the sharper statement: two mass
   estimates exist, they disagree by 54 %, and neither is FEA-verified (P5, P8).
2. **The paper claims an "ESPA-Grande-class envelope and mass allocation"** (abstract-level
   requirement, the Fig. 2 caption, and again in the accommodation section). The CAD closed
   envelope is 1839 mm against the ~1270 mm class limit, **P9, ~44 % over**. As written,
   the paper asserts a compatibility the geometry does not support.

Item 2 is the serious one: it is a capability claim, not a caveat, and it is the kind of
thing a reviewer with an ESPA user's guide open would catch immediately.

**Why this is not fixed yet.** Editing `paper.tex` without rebuilding the PDF would put the
source and the committed build out of step, and no TeX engine is available in the working
environment. It is also entangled with **P11**: until it is known which build is the
version of record, it is not clear whether this is a camera-ready edit or a corrigendum.
Resolve P11 first, then fix both items in one pass and rebuild.

### P13. The committed STEP set was mixed-generation, with two stubs: RESOLVED 2026-07-28
> **Status:** `CLOSED` — resolved; see the entry for what closed it

Found while importing `EMOCD_figs.zip`. The nine files in `cad/step/` matched no single CAD
generation, and two of them were single solids:

| Document | Was committed | Gen1 | Gen3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Stator | **1 body** | 324 | 162 conductors |
| Interface_ESPA | **1 body** | 6 | 6 + bolt holes |
| Sled | 12 | 5 | 16 |
| Payload_3U | 5 | 5 | 1 |
| Track | 6 | 8 | 4 |
| Assembly | 225 | 43 | 227 |

The stator export therefore contained no winding at all, while `cad/README.md` claimed
"STEP exports of every document" and the paper's §IV-B rests on a winding-resolved model.
Anyone opening the committed stator to check the conductor layout would have found a block.

**Resolved** by replacing the set with `cad/step/gen1|gen2|gen3/`, the three audited
generations. Body counts measured on import with `grep -c MANIFOLD_SOLID_BREP`, not copied
from the source changelog.

### P14. Gen3 CAD defects not previously tracked: CORRECTED 2026-08-13
> **Status:** `LIVE` — open engineering; something still has to be done

> **Corrected 2026-08-13 by supersession, not by fixing Gen3.** Gen5 is generated from
> `cad/parameters.json` by `cad/build_gen5.py` ([ADR-026](docs/adr/026-generated-cad.md)), and
> `build_gen5.py --check` reads 23 dimensions back out of the generated geometry and compares
> them to the parameter file. **It passes.** A defect of the form "the CAD disagrees with

>
> | | Gen3 defect | Disposition |
> |---|---|---|
> | **G3-D1** | Cassette height 640 mm against the parameter's 690 | **Gone.** `magazine.cassette_height_z = 690` and the generated model is built from it |
> | **G3-D2** | No roller channels, guide flanges or cross-tie outriggers | **Gone.** `build_gen5.py` builds *"two longerons with roller channels, guide rails and launch locks"* from `roller_channel_y_inner`, `guide_rail_y_inner/outer` and `guide_rail_z_contact` |
> | **G3-D4** | Stator layer count open, one layer or two | **Not a CAD defect and never was.** It is a design decision that sits upstream of K_t, and it is **PII-3** in `docs/VAULT.md`, priced at 20.61 m/s on a 7.50 kg sled |
>
> **Gen3 itself is not corrected and will not be.** It is a superseded generation kept for the
> record, like `legacy/`.

From the Gen3 audit in `cad/CHANGELOG_CAD.md`, verified against the exports where possible.
None of these were in this file before.

| ID | Defect | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| G3-D1 | Cassette height **640 mm** in Gen2 and Gen3 against `parameters.json` `magazine.cassette_height_z = 690` | 50 mm short. Either the CAD or the parameter is wrong; `parameters.json` wins by rule, so the CAD needs correcting |
| G3-D2 | Track is longerons and launch locks only, **no roller channels, guide flanges, or cross-tie outriggers**, all of which `parameters.json` specifies | The 205 mm overall track width exists only as a parameter. The rollers on the sled have nothing modelled to run in |
| G3-D4 | **Stator layer count undecided at the time.** Gen1 built two layers (324 conductors), Gen2 and Gen3 one (162) | `parameters.json` flags the decision open. Roughly x2 force for the same sheet current against x2 copper mass, never computed. This sits upstream of Kt and therefore of the headline velocity |
| G3-D5 | Halbach arrays **not re-centred** after the chassis grew 360 to 488 mm | `sled.halbach_array_x_start = 230 mm` is inherited from the shorter chassis. Array position relative to the winding is what Kt depends on |
| G3-D6 | **No payload-on-sled rigid joint** in any generation | `parameters.json` `documents.EMOCD_Assembly` specifies one. Without it the assembly cannot express the payload riding the sled, which is the thing being modelled |

| G3-D12 | **Assembly geometry extends 156 mm aft of the recorded envelope.** `EMOCD_Assembly_Gen3.step` spans x = −188 to 1810 mm; `parameters.json` records the installed envelope as −32 to 1807 mm | Either the assembly parks the sled further aft than the envelope assumed, or the envelope was measured without it. Found on 2026-07-28 while meshing the assembly for `cad/stl/`. It makes P9 worse, not better: 1998 mm against the ~1270 mm ESPA Grande class limit is ~57 % over rather than ~44 %. Measure which component owns the −188 mm face before changing either number |

**Resolved and recorded:** ESPA bolt holes (24x M9 on Ø400 mm BCD) were absent in Gen1 and
Gen2 and are modelled in Gen3, G1-D5 closed.

**Two discrepancies between `cad/CHANGELOG_CAD.md` and its own exports**, found on import
and left in place there with a note rather than edited:

- **The Gen3 brake-placement fix is not in the exports.** G2-D4 says the Gen2 brake sat at
  the local origin and Gen3 moved it to x = 1530 mm. `EMOCD_Brake_Gen2.step` and
  `EMOCD_Brake_Gen3.step` are geometrically identical, 3 bodies each, 79 points each,
  differing only in file name and time stamp, and **both** already place the brake at
  1530-1740 mm. The fix may have been applied to the Fusion document before the Gen2 export
  was taken; either way the export does not show the defect it is said to have.
- Body counts: `EMOCD_Payload_3U_Gen1.step` measures 5 solids where the inventory says 1,
  and `EMOCD_Sled_Gen1b.step` measures 11 where it says ~16.

The sled fix **is** verifiable: Gen2 chassis half-length measures 180 mm (360 mm plate),
Gen3 measures 244 mm (488 mm plate), so G2-D1 is genuinely closed.

The inherited `halbach_array_x_start = 230 mm` no longer governs, and **A16 computed the Gen4 finite-stator thrust on this layout**, reproducing `F_cmd` to 0.000 % at full overlap | **Answered.** The array position is now stated rather than inherited, and has been used in an analysis |

**What would close it:** the four carried defects corrected in CAD and re-exported, which the
Gen4 export gate already blocks on. **P14 does not close on this audit** — two of six are
answered by a configuration that is not yet in the repository, and the remaining four are
untouched.

### P15. The Gen3 sled as drawn is 9.45 kg, above BOTH existing estimates: RESOLVED 2026-07-29
> **Status:** `CLOSED` — resolved; see the entry for what closed it

> **RESOLVED by adoption.** 9.445 kg is now the operating point across `analysis/`, the
> paper and the figures. `mass_properties.py` keeps the parametric breakdown for the record

Original item follows for the audit trail.

Measured on 2026-07-28 from `cad/step/gen3/EMOCD_Sled_Gen3.step`: exact solid volumes from
the OpenCASCADE kernel, times material densities (NdFeB 7500 kg/m3 is this repo's own value,
from `sizing.py`).

| Estimate | Sled mass | Exit velocity |
|---|---|---|
| `mass_properties.py` parametric | 4.86 kg | 20.37 m/s |
| P5's CAD figure | 7.50 kg | 17.87 m/s |
| **Gen3 geometry, CAD solid-volume result** | **9.445 kg** | **16.53 m/s** at 10.7 g, 19.0 % efficiency |

The method reproduces P8 exactly when fed 7.50 kg, it returns 17.87 m/s against P8's stated
17.88, so the discrepancy is in the mass, not the method. Dominated by two chassis plates
(3.63 kg of titanium) and the magnet arrays (3.67 kg of NdFeB).

**What it does not settle.** This is geometry times density, not the structural FEA that A4
specifies. The plates are drawn solid with no lightening pockets, and a real design would
pocket them; the stiffness constraint (airgap held to ±0.05 mm) is still unevaluated. But
A4's pre-declared rule already says a mass at or above 6.80 kg makes 17.88 m/s the headline,
and this is well past that. **Whichever way the FEA goes, the 20.37 m/s headline is not
supported by the geometry that currently exists.**

Do not edit `analysis/*.py` on the strength of this. Run A4, then propagate once.

### P16. The lifetime-multiplier INVARIANCE claim is falsified: HIGH, NEW 2026-07-28
> **Status:** `CORRECTED` — found, fixed and propagated. Retained as the published record

GMAT R2022a, run headless against the bands declared in `validation/A5_astro_orekit.md`
before the run:

| Solar activity | GMAT multiplier | vs x1.80 | Band ±5 % |
|---|---|---|---|
| High (F10.7 250) | 1.7302 | −3.88 % | pass |
| Mean (F10.7 150) | 1.7750 | −1.39 % | pass |
| **Low (F10.7 70)** | **2.0739** | **+15.21 %** | **FAIL** |

Spread across the three: **18.48 %** against a ≤5 % band.

**The mechanism, and it is not subtle.** `analysis/astro.py` represents solar activity as a
uniform multiplicative scale on density (`rho(h, scale)`). Sweeping that scale across a
factor of **forty** moves the multiplier from 1.7992 to 1.7968, 0.1 %. A uniform density
factor divides both lifetimes by the same number, so **the ratio is preserved by
construction**. The sweep that the paper cites as demonstrating invariance cannot, in
principle, do so.

MSIS varies the *shape* of the density-altitude profile with F10.7, not only its magnitude.
The boosted orbit's apogee sits ~37 km above the baseline's, the two sample the profile
differently, and the ratio moves. Corroboration from the same runs: the absolute-lifetime
error changes **sign** across the range, GMAT is 2.5x longer at low activity, 9 % shorter
at mean, 23 % shorter at high. An error that changes sign is a wrong shape, not a
miscalibration.

**What survives:** x1.80 as a point value at mean and high activity, checked independently
and comfortably inside band. **What does not:** invariance.

Reproduce the sweep in six lines, no edit to any script:

```python
from analysis.astro import lifetime, boosted_elements, RE
a0 = RE + 450e3
ab, eb = boosted_elements(450e3, 20.37)
for s in (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0):
    print(s, lifetime(ab, eb, scale=s) / lifetime(a0, 0.0, scale=s))
```

**Where the claim appears:**

| Location | Text | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `paper/paper.tex` **abstract** | "a ratio shown invariant across ballistic coefficient and a fivefold solar-activity density range" | corrected 2026-07-29, multiplier now quoted at a stated activity level, no invariance claimed |
| `paper/paper.tex` Sec. V-B | "invariant to two decimal places" | corrected 2026-07-29, carries the GMAT three-level result and the mechanism |
| `paper/paper.tex` sensitivity section | "a multiplier invariant across a fivefold density range" | corrected 2026-07-29 |
| `paper/paper.tex` **Limitations** | "the demonstrated invariance of the ratio is the defensible result", the paper leaned on this specific claim | corrected 2026-07-29, no longer offered as the defensible result |
| `README.md`, `wiki/Home.md` headline tables | "x1.80, invariant across BC and solar activity" | corrected 2026-07-28 to "x1.80 at mean activity, invariance falsified, see P16" |

| `docs/INVENTORY.md` A32 | "Solar-activity UQ, x1.80 invariance" | flagged against P16 |
| `CHANGELOG.md` VAL2-02 | "Invariance spread 2.55 %, inside ≤5 %" | marked SUPERSEDED, text left intact as audit record |
| `paper/figures/F11_uq.png` **caption** | "absolute lifetimes vary fivefold; the x1.8 multiplier does not", a fifth location, missed when this list was written | corrected 2026-07-29, figure now plots `astro.py` against GMAT side by side |

**All documented locations are now corrected.** What is *not* closed:

1. **The BC half has still never been tested against a real atmosphere.** It is proven a
   tautology in `astro.py`, and the paper no longer claims it, but nobody has run GMAT at
   BC 40 and 90 to find out what the true BC dependence is. Until that happens the honest
   position is "unknown", not "invariant".
2. **The GMAT numbers themselves are now stale**, every run was at 20.37 m/s (P19).
3. **The committed PDF predates the correction** (`paper/README.md`).

This item stays open on (1).

**Ballistic-coefficient invariance is not "suspect", it is the identical tautology, proved
2026-07-29.** The abstract's sentence has two halves: invariant across *ballistic
coefficient* **and** across a *fivefold solar-activity density range*. Both rest on the same
construction. In `lifetime()` the drag term is

```python
ft = -0.5 * rho(h, scale) * v ** 2 / BC
```

`scale` and `1/BC` are the **same multiplicative slot**. Scaling one is mathematically
indistinguishable from scaling the other, so a BC sweep is a density sweep wearing a
different label. The reciprocal test confirms it exactly:

| Configuration | Multiplier |
|---|---|
| BC = 61, scale = 2.0 | 1.7987 |
| BC = 30.5, scale = 1.0 | **1.7987** |
| BC = 122, scale = 1.0 | 1.7991 |
| BC = 61, scale = 0.5 | **1.7991** |

And the plain sweep across a 5x BC range, 30 to 150 kg/m²: 1.7983 to 1.7992, spread
**0.05 %**.

So the position is worse than "one half falsified, one half untested". **Neither half of the
claim was ever tested by a method capable of falsifying it**, and the half that was
independently checked failed. Closing the BC half needs the same medicine as the solar half,
GMAT runs at BC 40 and 90, because MSIS's response to ballistic coefficient is not a uniform
rescale, for the same profile-shape reason found above.

**Do not edit `analysis/astro.py`.** Its arithmetic is not wrong; its atmosphere
parameterisation cannot express the effect being claimed. The fix is either a variable-shape
atmosphere in the script or dropping the invariance claim and keeping the point value,
that is a judgement, not a patch. Paper edits batch with P11/P12.

### P17. The inter-array attraction feeding the A4 FEA is 37 % high: **RESOLVED 2026-07-31 by A12**

`analysis/sizing.py::inter_array_attraction()` computes the force between the two opposed
Halbach faces from a flat-plate Maxwell-stress formula, a uniform pressure
`B_face**2 / (2*mu0)` at a mean face field of 0.55 T over the 340 x 90 mm footprint,
giving **3672 N**. That number was the applied load in the CalculiX A4 structural run
(`validation/results/A4_sled_structural.json`), and it had never been checked against
anything.

`magpylib.getFT()` meshes each magnet block and integrates the field gradient in three
dimensions. Driven by the repo's own array geometry (`build_field()`), so the two methods
cannot disagree about the magnets themselves:

| Mesh per block | Force |
|---|---|
| (2,2,2) | 2909.4 N |
| (4,4,4) | 2773.0 N |
| (6,6,6) | 2720.8 N |
| (8,8,8) | 2701.6 N |
| (10,10,10) | 2693.3 N |
| (12,12,12) | 2689.0 N |
| **(14,14,14)** | **2686.6 N** |

Converged (successive deltas halve (-8.3, -4.3, -2.5 N)) and insensitive to the
finite-difference step across four orders of magnitude (1e-5 to 1e-8, identical to 0.1 N).
**The analytic formula is high by 36.7 %.**

~~**The mechanism is understood, which is why this is a defect and not a disagreement.**
Maxwell stress needs the mean of `B**2`; the analytic form uses the square of the mean `B`;
and `mean(B**2) >= mean(B)**2` for any non-uniform field, by Jensen. A Halbach face field is
strongly non-uniform along the wavelength, so the analytic form must overestimate. It does.~~

> **CORRECTED 2026-07-31 by A12. The inequality is right and the conclusion drawn from it is

**What this does and does not damage.** The real force is *lower*, so A4's structural
results are conservative, not wrong: 0.0194 mm airgap closure and 33.7 MPa were computed
against a load 37 % heavier than the field model supports, and all three bands still passed.
No A4 conclusion reverses. What is damaged is the claim that A4's inputs were checked, they
were not, and this is the first time anyone looked.

**Reproduce:** `python3 validation/magpylib/check_inter_array_force.py` (no new dependency;
magpylib 5.2.3 is already in `requirements.txt`).

**Procedural note, stated rather than hidden.** This was computed *before* an acceptance band
was declared for it, which inverts this project's own rule. It is therefore logged as a
discrepancy, not as a validated result. Proper closure needs a run sheet with a band declared
in advance, and a decision about whether `sizing.py` adopts a corrected formula, which would
move `plate_stress_MPa`, ~~the retention-gate sizing,~~ and the A4 load together. **Do not edit
`sizing.py` on the strength of this entry.**

### P18. Four physical effects are absent from the model, not merely unvalidated: MEDIUM, NEW 2026-07-29
> **Status:** `LIVE` — open engineering; something still has to be done

Distinct from the E-items, which record analyses not yet run. These are terms that no script
contains, found by reading `sizing.py` and `motor_model.py` rather than the prose. Each is
carried as an E-item below (E19-E22); this entry exists so they are visible from the P-list,
because "the model does not contain this term" is a different class of gap from "this
analysis has not been run".

### Advanced or resolved by the CAD build (not full closures)
- **Launch restraint now exists as geometry.** The breech launch-lock blocks are modelled
  (`cad/parameters.json` `track`: `launch_lock` at x = 30-50 mm, 2 off). This advances
  **E10** (previously "concept-level"), the lock is drawn, though still not analysed.
- **Payload interface now models CDS corner rails** (see P6), giving the rail contact
  faces the interface-control drawing needs.

Adopting the CAD-derived 9.445 kg sled moved the rated velocity from 20.37 to 16.537 m/s. The
three analyses that have actually been run were all executed at the **old** point, so none of
them currently validates the design as it stands:

| Analysis | Run at | Still valid? |
|---|---|---|
| **A5** GMAT lifetime | dv = 20.37 m/s | **No.** Both baseline and boosted orbits change; the multiplier the scripts now give is x1.62, not x1.80. The *falsification* of the invariance claim (P16) survives, because that is about the shape of the model and not the velocity, but the numbers do not. |
| **A8** ngspice pulse chain | F = 1413.4 N, m = 8.86 kg, 2630 J | **Re-run 2026-07-30 as A8-R** against fresh bands, at 16.537 m/s. Five of six met; the closure row failed and produced P24. This half of the item is closed. |
| **A4** CalculiX chassis | 3672 N Maxwell attraction | **Yes, structurally.** The load is magnetostatic and does not depend on sled mass or velocity. **37 % heavy**, corrected to 2686.6 N by A12 — so A4 is conservative and is deliberately not re-run. |

**What this costs.** The validation table on the front pages says four of nine analyses have
run (A1 added 2026-07-29, and A1 alone is at the current operating point). Strictly, three have run *against a superseded design*. That is not the same claim, and
the difference is exactly the kind a reviewer notices.

**A8 is done.** A5 remains, and is days of wall time for the low-activity leg.
Neither should be re-run until the sled mass is settled, or the same staleness recurs; that
argues for closing the rib-stiffened-chassis question (P5, E2) **first**.

**Do not quietly restate the old results as if they still applied.** Every place the repo
quotes A5 or A8 numbers now needs the velocity they were obtained at stated alongside.

A1 ran and missed two of its seven declared bands. **One of the two is a defect in the run
sheet, not in the model.**

`validation/A1_field_femm.md` declares the array-surface band against
`analytic_B0_surface_T` = 0.7714 T. That is the fundamental amplitude of a **single** array's
ideal Halbach wave at its own surface. But any measurement at that plane in a **double-sided**
machine inevitably includes the opposing array, whose contribution there is
`B0·exp(-k·GAP)` = 0.160 T. The correct double-sided reference is **0.9317 T**.

The FEM's fundamental at that plane is **0.9312 T, a ratio of 0.9994 against the correct
value.** Measured as a raw peak it reads 1.4641 T, because the plane sits on the magnet face
where block-corner harmonics dominate and the field is formally singular at the corners; a raw
peak there is mesh-dependent and is not the same quantity as a fundamental amplitude either.

**So the row failed as declared, and the model is right.** Both statements are true and both
are recorded. The band is **not** widened, `validation/A1_field_femm.md` is left exactly as
written on 2026-07-27, because a run sheet edited after seeing results is worth nothing. The
correction belongs in the *next* run sheet.

**Fix:** when A2 (3-D) is specified, declare the array-surface band against the double-sided
value and against the **fundamental**, not a raw peak. Two references need naming, not one.

The second A1 band miss. FEM gives 0.93 mT against a 0.4 mT reference, ratio **2.32** against
a factor-2 band.

**Cause identified, and it is geometric.** The FEM is 2-D: the array is infinitely long out of
plane. The real array is **90 mm deep**. At 10 and 20 mm behind the back face the observation
distance is small against that depth and the two agree (ratios 1.16 and 1.14, both inside
band). At 50 mm the distance is comparable to the depth, a finite source falls off faster than
an infinite one, and the 2-D model necessarily overestimates.

This is **converged, not noise**: the value sits at 0.93 mT across box sizes 0.5-0.8 m and
across mesh refinements from 32 k to 141 k elements.

**Consequence:** a 2-D method cannot validate this row, by construction. `A1_field_femm.md`
already says A1 "does not close 3-D end effects", this is that limitation showing up in the
one row most sensitive to it. The magpylib reference, which models finite 90 mm blocks
exactly, is the more trustworthy number here and the FEM is not evidence against it.

**Do not** change `verify_field.py`. The row needs A2, a 3-D solve.

### P22. The novelty claim was wrong, and its replacement rests on abstracts: HIGH, NEW 2026-07-30
> **Status:** `CORRECTED` — found, fixed and propagated. Retained as the published record

A literature check found **published work on this exact concept that the paper did not cite.**
Full record in [`docs/PRIOR_ART.md`](docs/PRIOR_ART.md).

**What was wrong.** §I asserted *"no published deployment system operates in the tens of m/s."*
Feng, Yang & Wu (*Int. J. Aerospace Eng.* 2025, art. 3000765) analyse an on-orbit multi-stage
induction coilgun regulating a 20 kg CubeSat to **321.56 m/s**, with a reachable-domain analysis
serving the same purpose as this paper's lifetime and phasing argument. It was published
**2025-11-12, eight months before this repository went public.** The sentence was false as written.

**What it was changed to.** The regime is unserved *by flown hardware*, which is what the
comparator table always actually showed. The contribution is re-scoped to the narrower and more
defensible claim: a **programmable velocity delivered to an unmodified satellite inside its own
qualification envelope.** Both qualifiers carry weight, and against Feng they carry more than they
did against a spring:

| | Why it holds |
|---|---|
| Unmodified satellite | An induction coilgun accelerates a *conductive armature*, attached to the customer satellite, or a sabot needing its own separation. ADR-006 forbids the first |
| Inside the g-limit | 321.56 m/s at 10.7 g requires a **493 m track**; over 1.5 m it is **3515 g**. Not a secondary payload |

The g-limit argument is not new (ADR-003 made it in mid-2025) but it was an assertion and is now
arithmetic against a published number.

**The declared band, and what happened to it.** Before the full texts were obtained, this was
written down: *if Feng et al. report closed-loop per-satellite velocity regulation at dispersion
comparable to this design's 0.027 m/s 3σ, "programmable" stops being a differentiator; if they
report a track length making 321 m/s survivable for a standard CubeSat, §I needs rewriting rather
than adjusting.*

**All five papers were then supplied and read on 2026-07-30. Neither trigger fired, and three of
this entry's own conclusions turned out to be wrong.** Corrections in
[`docs/PRIOR_ART.md`](docs/PRIOR_ART.md); the material ones:

| Claimed from the abstract | After reading |
|---|---|
| "321.56 m/s at 10.7 g would need a 493 m track", a hypothetical | Their **actual** barrel is 3.9 m to **1352 g** mean, ~3060 g peak from their own >600 kN. The fact is far more decisive than the hypothesis |
| ADR-003's unsourced "1-2 % coilgun efficiency", removed *pending Einat* | **False.** Feng reports **14.9-19.9 %**, comparable to this design's own 20 %. Einat cannot settle it, a **2.5 g** projectile. Argument withdrawn as wrong, not deferred |
| *Aerospace* 12(6) 466 "has experimental verification" | True but narrower: a **32.8 mm/s transport mechanism**, not an ejection |

**Feng quotes no dispersion figure at all**, and controls velocity by charging-voltage selection
(10 to 16 kV to 230 to 321.56 m/s). So the dispersion differentiator survives, but as a claim about
*absent evidence*, not about impossibility, and it is written that way now. Feng is also
**simulation-only**, so on maturity this project and theirs are peers rather than this one being
behind.

**Why it stays open.** The claim corrections have landed, but two things are unfinished:

1. **The reachable-domain method should probably be adopted.** Feng's 3-D reachable-set envelope
   answers "which orbits does one shot make available" directly, where this project reports a scalar
   lifetime multiplier. That is a better astrodynamic product and it is the strongest thing to take
   from this literature. Not yet done, Phase II candidate.
2. **E24**, below: Xu et al. model attitude disturbance from the transfer mechanism itself. This
   project has nothing on disturbance from magazine indexing between shots.

**The maturity gap is real and remains.** The Harbin group built and measured a prototype. This
project has measured nothing. `docs/BENCHTOP_TESTS.md` already specified the answer as **B-1** and
**B-2**; what was added on 2026-07-30 is that their bands are now **derived** from an error budget
rather than chosen, by `validation/bench/bench_predict.py`. See E4.

### P23. The stroke time is stale in six places, and A8's band was set at the old one: MEDIUM, NEW 2026-07-30 — CLOSED 2026-08-10
> **Status:** `CLOSED` — resolved; see the entry for what closed it

Found while building the shot animation, which draws its time axis from `motor_model.shot()`
and came out at **157.3 ms** against the **127.7 ms** printed everywhere else.

127.7 ms is the superseded figure. Under constant acceleration the stroke time is `2s/v`:

| Operating point | 2s/v over the 1.30 m accel zone |
|---|---|
| 20.370 m/s, the pre-P15 point | 127.6 ms |
| 16.537 m/s, current | 157.2 ms |

So it belongs to the 4.86 kg parametric sled and survived the P8/P15 propagation in six
places: `README.md` twice, this file's E23 entry, `validation/A8_pulse_spice.md` twice, the
`CHANGELOG` record of A8's bands, and `docs/VALIDATION_REPORT.md`.

**The part that matters is not the typo.** `validation/A8_pulse_spice.md` declared a band of
**127.7 ms +/-10 %**, so 114.9 to 140.5 ms, and `VALIDATION_REPORT.md` records A8 passing it at
127.66 ms. At the current operating point the value is 157.3 ms, which is **23 % above the band
centre and outside the band entirely**. A8's recorded pass is a pass against a superseded
target.

This is the concrete instance of what P19 says in general. It is not a new failure: A8 ran
correctly against the operating point that existed when it ran. But "A8 passed" cannot be
quoted without saying which operating point it passed at, and until it is re-run the row in
`VALIDATION_REPORT.md` overstates what is known.

**Done:** the four prose occurrences corrected to 157.3 ms.

**Closed 2026-07-30 by A8-R.** The original band and its recorded result are left exactly as they
were, marked as belonging to the superseded point, because rewriting a declared band after the
fact to fit a new number is the one move that would make the whole validation record worthless.
Fresh bands were written and committed before the deck was touched, and the re-run passes the
pulse-duration row at 157.26 ms against 157.3. It failed a different row, which is P24.

**Swept and confirmed 2026-08-10, which is what this entry was still open for.** The entry
recorded the substance as closed but had never been checked against the file tree, so it stayed
`LIVE` on a bookkeeping technicality. Every surviving occurrence of 127.7 / 127.6 ms was read:

| Where | What it is | Correct as it stands? |
|---|---|---|
| this entry, ×4 | the record of the defect itself | **yes** — it is the account of the stale value |
| `validation/A8_pulse_spice.md` line 16, 29 | **the band as declared on the day**, 127.7 ms ±10 % | **yes, and must not be touched.** Editing a declared band after its run is the one move the project forbids |
| `validation/A8_pulse_spice.md` line 109 | A8-R's own note that the windows moved 127.7 → 157.3 ms | **yes** |
| `docs/VALIDATION_REPORT.md` line 123 | A8's pass, annotated "**at the superseded operating point**, see P23. The current value is 157.3 ms, outside this band" | **yes** |

**No stale prose survives.** The six places the entry named were four prose occurrences, since
corrected, and two declared-band occurrences that are correct precisely because they were not.
**The distinction between a stale number and a historical one is the whole of this item**, and
every remaining instance is on the right side of it.

### P24. No script carries a bank ESR, and the placeholder standing in for it is a factor of two high: HIGH, NEW 2026-07-30
> **Status:** `CORRECTED` — found, fixed and propagated. Retained as the published record

Found by A8-R, the re-run of the pulse-power simulation at the current operating point
(`validation/A8_pulse_spice.md`). Five of six bands passed. Energy closure failed at **97.0 %**
against a declared 98-102 %.

The simulated draw exceeds the analytic accounting by **86.6 J**. That gap is bank ESR
dissipation, which the circuit deck models and the analytic ledger has no term for:

| | |
|---|---|
| I^2 dt over the shot, integrated by ngspice | 7126.2 A^2 s |
| Bank ESR, per `sizing.py` | 0.012 ohm |
| Product | **85.5 J**, against an 86.6 J gap, agreeing to 98.7 % |

**The ledger is internally consistent and still understates the bank.** `energy_closure()` has no
ESR term, and the `E_DRAWN = 2795.6 J` it closes against comes from `motor_model.py`, which has no
ESR either. Both sides of the equation omit the same term, so the closure reads 100.0 % while the
real draw is about **2881 J**, 3 % higher.

**What moves if the term is carried:**

1. **`thermal_campaign()` carries `Q_esr = 160 J`** as a literal default. Against 85.5 J that is
   1.9x high, and the twelve-shot campaign falls from 28.9 to 28.0 kJ. It was flagged as unsourced
   during the P2 review and has had no second number against it until now.
2. **The per-shot energy headline, 2.80 kJ**, is the analytic draw and appears on the front pages.
   It becomes 2.88 kJ, and electrical-to-payload efficiency falls from 19.6 to about 19.0 %.
3. **Quoted bank sag, 5.19 %**, is the charge depletion with no ESR in the loop. The true figure is
   the 5.35 % A8-R measured.

### Retracted, same day it was written: the claim that the bank goes undersized

This entry first stated that `capacitor_sizing()` at the true draw wants **6.18 F** against the
6.0 F selected, and that the bank was therefore chosen against a draw omitting a loss it causes.
**That is wrong, and the error is in how it was computed.** The 6.18 F came from raising the
energy to 2881 J while holding `SAG_FRAC` at 5.19 %. The two are not independent: the ESR
dissipation is drawn out of the same capacitor, so a higher draw *is* the higher sag. Evaluated
consistently, at 2881 J and 5.35 %,

```
C = 2E / (V0^2 - V1^2) = 2(2881) / (96^2 - 90.864^2) = 6.00 F
```

against 6.0 F selected. **The bank is correctly sized and always was.** The sizing function is not
implicated, and the propagation below is a constant change rather than a design decision.

The mechanism is worth naming because it is a general trap in this repository: `capacitor_sizing()`
takes `E` and `sag_frac` as separate arguments, and its own docstring warns that `sag_frac` is the
droop the shot integration reaches rather than a target. Feeding it a new energy with a stale sag
violates that, and the function has no way to notice.

### Propagated 2026-07-30, in the same pass that wrote this entry

`motor_model.py` gained `R_ESR = 0.012` and now solves `R I^2 - Vc I + P = 0` for the current the
load draws at the bank **terminal** rather than at the capacitor, integrating `Vc*I` out of the
bank and `I^2 R` into a new `Q_esr` output. `sizing.py` follows: `E_DRAWN` 2795.6 to 2881.2 J,
`SAG_FRAC` 5.19 to 5.35 %, `energy_closure()` carries the term on both sides, and
`thermal_campaign()`'s literal 160 J becomes the computed 85.6 J.

Eleven result fields moved, all electrical or thermal. **Exit velocity, acceleration, stroke time,
dispersion, the payload family, mass and cost are unchanged**, which is the expected signature of
an electrical-only correction and was checked rather than assumed.

The correction also closed a disagreement nobody had attributed. A8 and A8-R both recorded peak
current about 5 % above the analytic model and put it down to the integrator. It was the ESR:
corrected, the model gives 346.77 A against ngspice's 346.8.

**This is a simulation result, not a measurement.** It gives a placeholder its first independent
number, which is what E17 asked for, and it is still one model checking another.

> **Superseded in part, 2026-07-30 by A10.** Everything above is arithmetically correct and
> still describes what the model does. What it assumed is not: **12 mohm is not purchasable at
> this bank capacitance**, and at a realistic value the shot does not close at all. The 86 J
> figure is therefore the ESR loss of a bank nobody can build. See **P26**.

### P25. A retracted claim stayed live in the paper, the wiki and two docs for a day: MEDIUM, NEW 2026-07-30
> **Status:** `CORRECTED` — found, fixed and propagated. Retained as the published record

P22 withdrew ADR-003's assertion that coilgun efficiency is "1-2 % in the literature", after
Feng et al. were found reporting **14.9-19.9 %** for a multi-stage on-orbit CubeSat launcher.
The withdrawal was recorded in `docs/adr/003`, `docs/PRIOR_ART.md`, `docs/RELATED_WORK.md` and
the changelog.

**It was not propagated to the places that actually assert it.** Four survived:

| Where | What it said |
|---|---|
| `paper/paper.tex` Table I | *Electrical to payload efficiency: coilgun 1-2 %, this work 19 %* |
| `paper/paper.tex` §II and §III | the same figure, once as background and once as a listed cost of the coilgun |
| `wiki/Home.md` | "1-2 % single-stage efficiency" in the locked-decisions list |
| `docs/PROJECT_NOTES.md` | the same, in the locked-decisions list |

**Table I is the one that matters.** It is the architecture trade, and that row claimed an
order-of-magnitude efficiency advantage that the prior art says does not exist. Corrected, the
row reads 14.9-19.9 % against 19 %, which discriminates not at all. The decision survives on the
rows that always carried it: no armature on the customer satellite, closed-loop velocity control,
and an abort path to 45 % of stroke.

**Found by reading the wiki page after publishing it**, not by any check. That is the finding.
The retraction was logged in four places and propagated to none, and nothing in the repository
notices when a ledger entry and an artifact disagree, because the mechanical guards
(`make_baseline.py --check`, `_check_operating_point()`, `check_links.py`) all compare artifacts
to *scripts*. A claim withdrawn in prose has no such guard.

**Half the general case is now fixed**, 2026-07-30. The same blindness had already shipped a
stale PDF: `paper.tex` was corrected twice and the published PDF went on printing the retracted
figure for five hours until it was found by hand.
[`tools/check_artifacts.py`](tools/check_artifacts.py) closes that half by comparing each built
artifact to the sources it was built from, using the commit each was last changed in rather than
file mtimes, which git does not preserve and which a fresh clone destroys. Verified against the
actual failure: at commit `c406da4` it reports the PDF **5.1 hours behind** its own source.

**The other half stays open and is the harder one.** A claim withdrawn in prose still has no
guard. Catching that needs a list of load-bearing claims and where each is asserted, which is
`docs/PROVENANCE.md`'s job and would roughly double it. What is now true is that the *mechanical*
half of this defect cannot recur silently.

### P26. The supercapacitor bank cannot source the shot: HIGH, NEW 2026-07-30
> **Status:** `CORRECTED` — found, fixed and propagated. Retained as the published record

P24 recorded that the 12 mohm bank ESR had no source. Looking for one found that the value is
not merely unsourced, it is **not attainable from the cells the design specifies**, and that the
shot does not close without it. Full run: [`validation/A10_bank_esr.md`](validation/A10_bank_esr.md).

**The physics.** For an EDLC, ESR times capacitance is roughly constant within a cell
technology: both are set by the same electrode area and separator. Two Eaton 3.0 V cells thirty
times apart bracket it, and series stacking preserves the product because R scales with N and C
with 1/N.

| Cell | C | ESR | ESR x C |
|---|---|---|---|
| TV1860-3R0107-R | 100 F | 11 mohm | 1.10 s |
| XL60-3R0308T-R | 3000 F | 0.23 mohm | 0.69 s |
| **This bank, as modelled** | **5.94 F** | **12 mohm** | **0.071 s** |

The bank as modelled is an order of magnitude better than either commercial cell. At a realistic
product it is **116 to 185 mohm**.

**The consequence is not a worse efficiency. It is no shot at all.** A source of EMF V behind
series resistance R cannot deliver more than `V^2/4R` into any load. At the rated point the
shot needs 30.0 kW at peak velocity. A10 swept the integrator and found the design completes up
to **65 mohm and fails from 70**, against the 116 to 185 mohm the cells actually give.

| | |
|---|---|
| Hard ceiling on bank ESR | **65 mohm** |
| A single string of 32 x 190 F cells | **116 to 185 mohm** |
| Margin | **none: short by 1.8x to 2.8x** |

**Nothing else in the design is implicated.** Exit velocity, stroke time and dispersion do not
move anywhere in the sweep, because the commanded force is constant and the mechanical
integration never sees the bank until the bank fails to source it. K_t, the magnets, the
winding and the control loop are untouched. This is a pulse-power defect and it is contained
there.

**Not propagated, and that is deliberate.** The baseline still reads 16.537 m/s at 2.88 kJ,
which assumes a 12 mohm bank that cannot be bought. `docs/BASELINE.md`'s change-control rule
admits error correction; what is needed here is a **sizing decision**, and taking one on the
strength of two datasheet points would be exactly the reasoning this repository logs defects
about. Options costed as **PII-7**.

**The gap that let this through, and it is on the record already.**
[`docs/LITERATURE.md`](docs/LITERATURE.md) has 136 entries across nine clusters, and its
pulsed-power-and-capacitors cluster has **two**. The file names that cluster as the sample's
blind spot in its own words. The one area nobody filled is the one that turned out to carry a
defect big enough to stop the machine.

**What is still soft.** Both cell figures come from distributor listings of manufacturer data,
not from the manufacturer PDFs, which are unreachable from the environment this was written in.
A third mid-range point was not obtained. If space-qualified cells behave differently the
numbers move, though the ceiling at 65 mohm does not: that is set by this design's own power
demand and is independent of any datasheet.

### P27. A numerical guard hid the failure it was written next to: MEDIUM, NEW 2026-07-30
> **Status:** `CORRECTED` — found, fixed and propagated. Retained as the published record

Found by A10 on its first run, before it found anything about the bank.

`shot()` solves `R I^2 - Vc I + P = 0` for the current drawn at the bank terminal. When the
discriminant went negative it fell back to `I = P/Vc`, the current the load would draw with no
ESR at all. That branch was added on 2026-07-30 in the same commit as the ESR term itself,
as an ordinary numerical guard.

**A negative discriminant is not a numerical edge case. It is the bank being unable to source
the demanded power**, which is precisely the condition A10 exists to detect. The fallback
converted it into a completed run with a working machine in it, at every resistance tested.

The tell was visible in the output and nearly missed: **peak current fell from 630 A at 70 mohm
to 331 A at 183 mohm.** Demanded power was fixed, so current cannot fall as resistance rises.

**Fixed:** the branch raises `BankLimitError`, naming the power demanded, the `V^2/4R` ceiling,
and the point in the stroke where it was hit. The baseline is unaffected, because at 12 mohm the
discriminant never goes negative.

**The general lesson, which is why this is a numbered defect and not a commit message.** Every
other guard in this repository fails loudly: `_check_operating_point()` exits, `make_baseline.py
--check` exits, `bench_predict.py` raises on geometry drift. This one substituted a plausible
value and continued. A guard that degrades silently is worse than no guard, because it converts
a detectable failure into a credible wrong answer.

**Corrected.** Marked 2026-08-10 after verifying the fix in the source rather than taking the
entry's word for it: `analysis/motor_model.py` defines `BankLimitError` and `shot()` raises it on
`disc <= 0`, naming the demanded power, the `V²/4R` ceiling and the stroke position. The silent
`I = P/Vc` fallback is gone. Retained as the published record — the defect is worth keeping
because the lesson about silently degrading guards is, not because anything remains to be done.

### P28. The regen stator and the eddy fin do not both fit the arrest section: CORRECTED 2026-08-13
> **Status:** `CLOSED` — resolved; see the entry for what closed it
> **Corrected.** `S_REGEN` 240 → 39 mm, so 39 + 300 fits the 339 mm section. Recovery falls
> 291 → 47 J and efficiency to 18.8 % net. **Dropping regen entirely was recommended first and
> withdrawn**: it costs 2 points of efficiency, which is in no kill criterion, to raise brake duty
> 24 %, which makes **E34** — fourth on the lethality ranking — worse. **ADR-030.**
Opened by A11 in the act of adopting regenerative braking, and recorded rather than designed
around.

The closed envelope is 1839 mm and release is at 1500 mm, so the arrest section is **339 mm**.
A11 assumes 240 mm of it carries regenerative stator. The eddy fin as sized in `sizing.py` is
**300 mm** long (0.86 kg of 4 mm copper). **240 + 300 > 339.** Both live in the same airgap, so
they cannot overlap.

**The thermal half is not the problem.** Regeneration cuts the fin's duty from 1291 to 952 J, a
26 % reduction, and the fin's adiabatic rise falls from 4.0 to 3.0 K. A fin a third of the
length would still hold its transient.

**The mechanical half is unresolved, and it is tighter than it looks.** Eddy force is
proportional to velocity, so distance to arrest is linear in the velocity removed:
`x = (m/c)*(v0 - v1)`. At the first-order coefficient `paper/make_figures.py` uses,
`c = 670 N*s/m`, the sled needs **186 mm** to fall from 14.2 to 1.0 m/s, and only about 99 mm
would remain. Closing that means **c rising to roughly 1210 N*s/m, a factor of 1.8**, which puts
peak deceleration at **186 g against the 200 g taper cap** — inside it, with 7 % to spare, on a
cap that exists to protect the bonded magnet interfaces. That is not a comfortable margin, and
it is the reason this is a numbered defect and not a note.

**Regeneration is what makes the repartition even arguable.** Without it the sled enters the
brake at 16.5 m/s and the same 99 mm would need `c = 1440`, putting peak deceleration past the
cap outright. The 240 mm of regenerative stator pays part of its own packaging cost.

**Why this is logged instead of fixed.** The obvious fix is to shorten `fin_mass` in
`thermal_campaign()` until the numbers fit. `validation/README.md`'s conventions forbid exactly
that: *"do not hand-edit a script to match an FEA result, record the discrepancy first, decide
second."* The same applies to hand-editing one to match a packaging wish. `sizing.py` keeps the
300 mm fin and carries a comment saying it does not fit.

**What would close it.** A repartitioned arrest-section layout with the fin resized on eddy
authority rather than on heat, checked against the 200 g deceleration cap and the ring-spring
handover below 1.5 m/s. It is mechanical design, and it is the reason A11 says plainly that it
answers the electromagnetic question only.

### P29. The paper says the winding is segmented; the model charges copper for all 1.3 m: MEDIUM, NEW 2026-07-31 — CLOSED 2026-08-10
> **Status:** `CLOSED` — resolved; see the entry for what closed it

Found while pricing a longer track, and it is a question about the machine as built rather than
about any proposal.

`paper/paper.tex` §VII states, under redundancy: *"the winding is segmented so a shorted coil
degrades thrust rather than ending the campaign."* `motor_model.shot()` computes copper loss as
`RHO_CU * J^2 * vol_cu` with `vol_cu = ACCEL_ZONE * DEPTH * WIND_THICK * FILL`, that is, **the
whole 1.30 m winding carrying full current density for the entire 157 ms stroke**.

Those are not consistent with each other. A segmented long-stator machine energises the section
under the mover — roughly the sled's 340 mm active length — and switches segments as it passes.

**What it is worth.** Energising 340 mm rather than 1300 mm takes copper loss from **827.9 J to
about 217 J**, and electrical-to-payload efficiency from 21.2 % to roughly **24.4 %**, with no
design change whatsoever. It also drops peak current from 347 to about 296 A, which raises the
A10 bank ESR ceiling from 66 to about 79 mohm — relevant to P26, though not enough to reach a
single commercial string at 116.

**Three possibilities and this repository cannot currently distinguish them.**

1. The winding is segmented for *fault tolerance* but driven as one, in which case the model is
   right and the paper's sentence is about failure modes only. Then nothing is wrong and the
   distinction needs stating, because a reader will assume block commutation.
2. The winding is block-commutated and the model is deliberately conservative. Then the
   conservatism is real engineering judgement and **it is written down nowhere**, which is the
   same defect class as the 12 mohm ESR (E17): a value with no provenance.
3. It is simply inconsistent, and `Q_copper` is overstated by a factor of about 3.8.

**Why this is logged rather than fixed.** Changing `vol_cu` moves a baseline number, and which
way it should move depends on a design decision nobody has recorded. Guessing in either direction
would put an unsourced value into the baseline, which is exactly what P24 and E17 exist to stop.
`cad/parameters.json` `groups.stator` records conductor counts and belt geometry but says nothing
about drive segmentation, so the CAD cannot settle it either.

**What would close it.** A recorded decision on how many stator segments exist and how many are
energised at once, then `motor_model.py` computing `vol_cu` from that rather than from
`ACCEL_ZONE`, with the paper's redundancy sentence and the drive description made to agree.
Both numbers then follow from one stated fact instead of two unstated ones.

### P30. An acceptance band was set at the easier of two available comparators: MEDIUM, NEW 2026-07-31
> **Status:** `LIVE` — open engineering; something still has to be done

**A defect in how a band was chosen, not in a number.** This repository has no other entry of that
kind, which is the reason to write it down.

`validation/A7_separation_chrono.md` declared its tip-off band as **≤ 5 °/s/axis**, citing the
NanoRacks NRCSD-E interface document. Three other files — E7 above, `docs/KILL_CRITERIA.md` §4 and
PII-1's entry criterion in `docs/VAULT.md` — carried a standing flag that this "conflicts" with
a sibling NRCSD ICD quoting 2 °/s, and that the conflict had to be resolved before the band meant
anything. PII-1, the best available velocity lever, was gated on it.

**There is no conflict. They are two different deployers and both numbers are right:**

| | Tip-off target | |
|---|---|---|
| **NRCSD**, internal, ISS airlock | **< 2 °/s/axis** | flown hundreds of times |
| **NRCSD-E**, external, Cygnus-mounted | < 5 °/s/axis | *"additional testing and analysis are being completed... to refine and verify this value"* — its own publisher |

**What that leaves is worse than the flag it replaces.** The band was set at the looser of the two
comparators, taken from the document whose publisher describes the figure as provisional, with
nothing recorded about the tighter flown number existing. Nobody chose the easy number on purpose;
it is what happens when a band cites one source and no one asks what else the source set contains.
**That is the failure mode acceptance bands exist to prevent, occurring inside the band-setting
step itself.**

**Fixed 2026-07-31.** A7's band is now **2 °/s/axis** with NRCSD-E retained as a secondary
reference and labelled provisional. **A7 has never run**, so this is a band tightened before
results rather than after — the distinction the whole validation record depends on, and the sheet
states it above the table. The cost is real: A7 is now **2.5x harder to pass**, on a release path
with no multibody model behind it and a payload centre of mass 70 mm off the thrust line.

**The general rule this implies**, added to `validation/README.md`: *when a band cites an external
document, record which document, which revision, and whether a tighter comparator exists in the
same family.* One line, and it would have caught this.

### P31. The repository carries two different inter-shot cadences and reconciles neither: **RESOLVED 2026-08-05 by ADR-020**
> **Status:** `CLOSED` — resolved; see the entry for what closed it


> **The ConOps interval is 1200 s.** Adopted in [`docs/adr/020-inter-shot-cadence.md`](docs/adr/020-inter-shot-cadence.md) because it is the number `astro.py`'s conjunction model,
> the realignment period and the deployment safety case were already computed against, so
> adopting it invalidates nothing, while 10-20 s would require re-running A6 against a
> geometry never evaluated. **A13's failed bands are NOT re-declared against it** -- this
> entry's own instruction, that doing so is a band change belonging declared and dated, is
> followed. Rows 3 and 4 remain FAIL; what changed is their operational significance.
Found while costing A13's failure, and it decides whether that failure matters.

| Where | Interval | For what |
|---|---|---|
| `paper/paper.tex` §III-C | **10–20 s** | described as "set by supercapacitor recharge, at a 150–300 W allocation" |
| `analysis/astro.py` `conjunction(spacing_s=1200.0)` | **1200 s** | the spacing the 30-day conjunction analysis actually models |

**Twenty seconds and twenty minutes, in the same repository, for the same event.** They are not
necessarily contradictory — a machine able to fire every 18 s may still be *operated* every
20 minutes — but **nothing anywhere states which is the ConOps**, and two published analyses
depend on different ones. The conjunction geometry, the realignment period and the whole safety
case are computed at 1200 s. The thermal case is argued at 10–20 s.

**The recharge claim is also wrong, which A13 established separately.** The mechanical chain
between shots — index, sled return, attitude settling — has a floor of **18.1 s** at a 6.9 s
return, against a recharge of 8.6 s at 300 W and 17.2 s at 150 W. **Attitude settling binds at
both allocations.** The paper's sentence has been corrected; this entry is about the second
number, which the correction does not touch.

**Why it matters for A13.** At 1200 s the 8.2 s settling is 0.7 % of the interval and A13's band 5
tested against the wrong quantity. At the 18.1 s floor it is 45 % of it. **The same failure is
either irrelevant or dominant depending on a number nobody has written down.**

**What would close it:** state the ConOps cadence once, in one place, with the reason — and make
`astro.py`'s `spacing_s` default read from it rather than carry an independent literal. If the
answer is 1200 s, A13's bands 3–5 should be re-declared against it and re-run; **that is a band
change and belongs declared and dated, not quietly applied to an existing failure.**

### P32. The working Gen4 geometry has no corresponding operating point: CORRECTED 2026-08-13

The published Phase I result assumes a uniform 1.30 m active stator and release at 1500 mm.
`EMOCD_Gen4_Open v7` instead places the same 488 mm sled at s = 300 mm stowed and s = 1200 mm
release, a 900 mm acceleration stroke. Its 340 mm Halbach array is fully over the stator only
through s = 1051.5 mm. The final 148.5 mm is a finite-edge region, and 191.5 mm of the array
remains over the stator at release.

The current 16.388 m/s, 10.53 g, 2851 J gross and 20.99% net values are still reproducible for
the frozen Phase I geometry. They are not Gen4 results. No public document may attach them to
the open assembly, and a constant-thrust calculation shortened to 900 mm would not repair the
mismatch because it would ignore the changing overlap.

The provisional stationing does resolve one geometry conflict: release is at s = 1200 mm and
the fin enters the brake at s = 1222 mm, leaving 22 mm between the two events. The fin then has
330 mm of travel through the brake before its trailing edge clears at s = 1552 mm. Those are
kinematic envelope results, not an arrest or thermal validation.

**What would close it:** E27's position-dependent force calculation, followed by one controlled
propagation through power, energy, thermal, braking, orbit, paper and validation records. Until
then the Gen4 export gate stays closed and the Phase I baseline remains the only rated point.

### P33. The paper credits a winding inductance nobody had computed: MEDIUM, NEW 2026-08-05
> **Status:** `LIVE` — open engineering; something still has to be done


`paper/paper.tex` says the drive switches at 20-40 kHz, "high enough that the current ripple is
filtered by the winding inductance and low enough to keep switching loss within the converter's
97 J/shot budget." **There was no inductance anywhere in this repository.** No henry in
`analysis/`, and no phase current either: `motor_model.shot()` integrates in *sheet* current
(A/m), and the `I_peak` it reports is the **DC-link current drawn from the bank**, not the
current in a conductor. Every "peak current" figure in this project, including the lever table in
`docs/DESIGN_OPTIONS_exit_velocity.md` and A10's ESR ceiling, is that DC-link number.

The gap is structural rather than clerical. A sheet-current model is turns-invariant: the same
126 kA/m can be wound as many turns at low current or few at high current, L scales as N², phase
current as 1/N, and the stored field energy is the same either way. **So the model cannot
produce an inductance, and the claim above could not have been checked when it was written.**

`analysis/drive_electrical.py` closes it on the one constraint that does fix the turns count:
the inverter has to synthesise the phase voltage the machine demands at rated speed, out of a
96 V bus sagged to 90.9 V. The required volt-amps are invariant under the turns count, so the
design point follows without a new winding assumption.

| | |
|---|---|
| Armature-reaction field energy | **2.058 J** (harmonic sum over the belt distribution) |
| Peak phase current | **373.2 A**, against the 338.8 A DC-link figure quoted everywhere |
| Phase inductance | **19.70 µH** |
| Phase resistance | **25.18 mΩ** |
| Electrical time constant | **0.782 ms**, fast against the 158.6 ms stroke |
| Modulation index at exit | **1.00**, by construction |
| Ripple at 20 kHz | **60.9 A pp, 16.3 % of peak** |
| Ripple at 40 kHz | **30.5 A pp, 8.2 % of peak** |

**Half the paper's sentence survives and half does not.** The loss half is fine: the ripple adds
**3.71 J to an 834.7 J** copper budget at 20 kHz, four tenths of one percent, so nothing in the
thermal or energy record moves. The filtering half does not: **16 % peak-to-peak ripple at
20 kHz is not a filtered current**, and the sentence asserts it of the whole 20-40 kHz range.
Only the top of that range is defensible.

**Two consequences that are not in any document.** First, the SiC devices carry the phase
current, so they are being selected against **373 A** and the repository only ever wrote down
339 A; the paper specifies the 1200 V rating and never a current rating. Second, exit velocity
and phase current are locked together through the bus: more velocity means more back-EMF, which
means fewer turns, which means more current, which lands on the bank ESR ceiling **P26** already
tracks. That coupling is real but it is **not a new velocity ceiling** — the machine can be
rewound for any speed, it just pays in current — and it should not be written up as one.

**What would close it:** a winding layout with an actual turns count, conductor cross-section
and end-turn geometry, at which point L stops being inferred from an energy balance and becomes
a property of drawn hardware. The 2-D energy method here omits end turns entirely, so 19.70 µH
is a **lower bound** and the ripple figures are upper bounds. `docs/VAULT.md` PII-7 and the
segmentation decision in **P29** both move it: energising less stator cuts L and R together.

### P34. A payload carrying a magnetometer cannot fly in this magazine: HIGH, NEW 2026-08-05
> **Status:** `LIVE` — open engineering; something still has to be done


> **EXTENT BOUNDED 2026-08-05.** `analysis/far_field_sensitivity.py` profiles the field outward
> from the thrust line. It falls below magnetometer full scale only at **z = 251 mm** and below
> Earth's own field at **z = 332 mm**. The 3U payload envelope spans z = 20 to 120 mm, so
> **every part of the payload sits above magnetometer full scale** -- 610.8x at the near face and
> still 3.4x at the far face. This is not a near-face problem with a safe interior; it is the
> whole satellite.

**Found by A14, against a band declared before the run.** The payload's nearest face sits **6 mm**
behind the Halbach array back face — `cad/parameters.json` puts the array back face at z = 14 mm
and a 3U payload at z = 20 to 120 mm — and the static field there is **61.1 mT**. That is
**1357× Earth's field** and **611× the full scale of the class of magnetometer a CubeSat carries
to sense Earth's field.**

**This is a payload compatibility constraint and it is not in the interface specification.**
`paper.tex` §on the interface lists four things VOLLEY asks of a host and publishes a magnetic
keep-out radius for the *host*. Nothing anywhere states what the deployer does to the satellite
inside it. A customer flying a magnetometer, a magnetorquer, a fluxgate, or anything with
soft-magnetic structure is affected, and "the satellite is never modified" — the central claim of
this project — is doing quiet work here that it has not earned.

**What A14 did and did not establish.** The 61.1 mT figure is in the exponential near field where
the model reproduces the 10 mm station exactly, so it is sound. The centre-of-mass and far-face
figures, 0.463 and 0.341 mT, sit in the edge-effect tail that **P3** already records this model
getting wrong, so the *extent* of the affected volume is not established. A14's band 5 is VOID
for that reason and for the absence of a materials list.

**What would close it,** in the order that costs least:

1. ~~**State the exposure.**~~ **DONE 2026-08-10**, `docs/PAYLOAD_ENVIRONMENT.md`. The field is
   published across the whole 3U envelope, z = 20 to 120 mm, against both comparators, with the
   two-regime structure and the exposure duration stated. P3 no longer blocks it and had not for
   some time.
2. **Decide whether it is a constraint or a defect.** **This is now the whole of P34.** A
   saturated magnetometer recovers and a magnetorquer becomes uncommandable but recovers;
   **remanent magnetisation of soft-magnetic parts does not**, and only the third is a
   modification. That distinction needs a **payload materials list**, which this project does not
   have and will not invent — A14's band 5 was declared VOID-able in advance on exactly this
   ground. It needs a customer or a stated reference payload. **Open.**
3. **T-6** measures it. Its priority rises on this result. **Open.**

**One thing the specification found that was not in the original entry.** The deployer's own load
path contains soft-magnetic material: the magazine septum is **silicon steel**, 1.0 mm, between
adjacent satellites (`cad/parameters.json` `groups.magazine.septum_material`). It will both shunt
flux, which helps, and itself magnetise, which changes the field a neighbouring satellite sees.
**Nothing has modelled that**, and it is a second reason the in-cassette field is not simply the
sled field at greater distance. The cassette case remains unmodelled and is stated as such in the
specification rather than left to be assumed benign.

Shielding the payload is the option that should be resisted: it adds mass to the customer's
satellite, which is the modification the architecture exists to avoid.

`validation/gmat/build_scripts.py` carries `DV = 20.37` under a header saying the operating point
is "identical to `astro.py` __main__ and `conjunction()` defaults". **It is not.** `astro.py`'s
`conjunction()` default is now `dv=16.388`, three corrections later. Anyone regenerating the A5 or
A6 inputs today gets scripts at a velocity the project abandoned on 2026-07-29.

**It is LOW because nothing currently reads it wrongly.** A5 and A6 *were* run at 20.37 and their
sheets say so, so the generator matches the results it produced. The defect is that the file
claims to track `astro.py` and silently does not, which is the same failure class as the stray
`results/sizing.json` and the stale companion generator: **a second copy of an operating point
that nothing regenerates.**

**Deliberately not fixed by editing `DV`.** Changing it would make regenerated scripts differ from
the ones whose results are recorded, which trades one dishonesty for another. A15 therefore got
its own generator, `build_poem_campaign.py`, which reads Δv from `motor_results.json` at run time
and cannot go stale.

**Which branch was taken, 2026-08-13: the second.** The generator stays pinned to 20.37 m/s so
it keeps matching the results it produced, the false "tracks `astro.py`" claim is struck, and an
import-time assertion now fails if the pin ever silently becomes true. **The original criterion,
written when this was opened:** either re-run A5 and A6 at the current point and update the generator
together, or mark `DV` explicitly as the frozen historical value those two analyses were run at
and delete the claim that it tracks `astro.py`. The second is honest and costs nothing.

`sizing.py::track_first_mode()` checks the track against one static target -- above 70 Hz to clear
the launch primary band. **A17 shows that is necessary and not sufficient.** Every shot chirps the
force ripple through the 109 Hz fixed-fixed mode, and the mode amplifies it **8.18x** at the
fundamental crossing, twelve times per campaign.

**It does not go away with damping.** Amplification moves from 6.51 at Q = 20 to 8.33 at Q = 500,
so no plausible bolted-aluminium Q rescues it. The governing parameter is the normalised sweep
rate `rate/f^2 = 0.18`, slow enough for the mode to respond fully regardless of Q.

**What the project does not have:** any damping specification, loss factor or Q for the track; a
moving-load model, since the ripple force travels with the sled and A17's SDOF does not represent
that; and a dynamic acceptance criterion beside the static 70 Hz one.

**What would close it:** a damping specification with a measurement behind it, and a moving-load
response model. **T-2's sine sweep becomes a pass/fail qualification item rather than a signature
comparison** on this result, and that belongs in `docs/QUALIFICATION_PLAN.md`.

**Not a kill criterion.** A17's displacement estimate -- 49 % of the +/-0.05 mm gap budget --
rests on an assumed effective mass and the unmodelled moving load, so it shows the coupling
matters without establishing that it breaks anything.

### P37. The retention gates were sized against a quasi-static load, not the launch environment: HIGH, NEW 2026-08-06
> **Status:** `LIVE` — open engineering; something still has to be done


**Found by A18 band 9, against a band declared before the run.** `sizing.py` sizes the retention
gate at **5.9 kN** through two D6 A-286 pins at MoS 1.2. Miles' equation on the GEVS protoflight
spectrum (14.1 g_rms, 0.16 g^2/Hz) at the track's 109 Hz fixed-fixed mode gives **11.7 kN at
Q = 10 and 20.2 kN at Q = 30** -- two to three and a half times the load the gates were sized for.

| Q | 3-sigma load | vs sized | MoS |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 10 | 11.7 kN | 1.98x | 0.56 |
| 20 | 16.5 kN | 2.80x | **0.10** |
| 30 | 20.2 kN | 3.43x | **-0.10** |

**The pins may not be undersized; the load case was.** 5.9 kN is quasi-static. Random vibration
through a lightly damped 109 Hz mode is a different problem, and the claimed MoS 1.2 collapses to
0.10 at Q = 20 and goes negative at Q = 30, past the pins' 18.2 kN shear capacity.

**This compounds P36.** Both turn on a structural Q this project has never specified or measured,
and both make the same test decisive. `docs/QUALIFICATION_PLAN.md` already calls T-1 *"the single
most likely qualification failure"*; **it is now a predicted failure rather than a ranked risk.**

**What would close it:** a damping specification with measurement behind it, then resize the gates
against the random-vibration case, or isolate the cassette stack so the mode does not drive the
pins. **This is analysis only -- T-1 closes the test half of E10 and nothing here substitutes.**

> **RESIZED 2026-08-10 by A22, and the fix is eleven grams.** The gates go from **2 x D6 to
> 2 x D9 A-286 pins**: capacity 18.2 -> **41.0 kN**, and the margin of safety at Q = 30 goes
> **-0.36 to +0.45**. Across the whole sweep it stays positive, **+0.45 at Q = 30 to +1.51 at
> Q = 10**, so **the design no longer depends on where Q lands** -- which is the entire point,
> since A19 found Q was the only assumed input moving a margin through zero.
>
> **No architecture change was needed.** Splitting the stack across two gates was in the allowed
> space and is not required, so the magazine is untouched. The quasi-static case improves as
> well, MoS 1.21 -> 3.98, and **pin shear still governs** over bearing at 41.0 against 52.2 kN,
> so resizing pins was the right fix rather than the wrong one.
>
> **A definitional discrepancy fell out of it.** A18 quotes this margin as **-0.10**, computed as
> capacity/load - 1; `sizing.py` applies a **1.4 design factor** and gives **-0.36** for the same

> **The test half is untouched.** T-1 still closes E10, and Q is still unmeasured.

### P38. The paper claimed a payload magnetic environment its own validation had already falsified: CORRECTED 2026-08-10
> **Status:** `CORRECTED` — found, fixed and propagated. Retained as the published record


**Corrected in the manuscript and the PDF rebuilt, 2026-08-10.** The EMC section stated that
because the Halbach self-shielding weak side faces outward, *"a magnetometer-carrying customer
payload sees a field comparable to a conventional reaction-wheel assembly at the same standoff"*.

**A14 band 4 falsified that on 2026-08-05** at **611× magnetometer full scale**, and opened
**P34** on the strength of it. The sentence survived for five days after the run that disproved
it, in the published PDF, because A14's outcome was propagated into `OPEN_PROBLEMS.md` and
`docs/KILL_CRITERIA.md` and not into `paper.tex`.

**This is the P25 failure mode with a longer fuse.** P25 recorded a retracted claim staying live
for a day; this is a falsified claim staying live for five, in the artifact most likely to be
read by someone outside the project. The defect is not the original sentence — it was written
before A14 existed and was a reasonable guess — it is that **nothing connects a failed validation
band to the deliverables that repeat the claim it failed.** `tools/check_artifacts.py` catches a
PDF older than its source; nothing catches a source older than its own validation result.

**Closed on its own terms, and the criterion says so.** **The original wording:** the correction is made, so the sentence itself is closed. The general
case is not, and is the part worth keeping: a band that FAILS should name the documents that
assert the thing it falsified, the way `docs/BASELINE.md` change control already requires a
baseline change to *"state which validations it invalidates"*. That rule exists in one direction
only. **Carried as the open half of this entry.**

### P39. The companion repositories were not a function of the commit they claim: CORRECTED 2026-08-10
> **Status:** `LIVE` — open engineering; something still has to be done


**Corrected 2026-08-10 in `tools/export_companion.py`.** Found while regenerating the companions
from a clean clone, because the regeneration **deleted twelve files nobody had removed**.

`copy()` walked the **working tree** with `shutil.copytree`, so every file sitting inside a
manifest directory went into the companion whether or not the flagship tracked it. The published
`VOLLEY-paper` and `VOLLEY-thesis` therefore carried `validation/fea/plate.inp`,
`plate_clamped.frd`, `plate_clamped.dat`, `plate_modal.*` and the rest of A4's CalculiX
input decks and solver output — **twelve paths that are in no VOLLEY commit at all.**
`git log --all --diff-filter=A -- 'validation/fea/plate*'` returns nothing. The flagship tracks
exactly one file in that directory, `build_deck.py`.

**The stray files are not the defect. The provenance is.** Each companion carries a banner
reading *"generated from VOLLEY flagship 45332a7"*, and that statement was false: the tree it
described contained files that commit does not have. Worse, the output depended on **what
happened to be lying around when the export ran** — a machine that had executed A4 produced a
different companion from a clean clone of the identical commit.

**A generated artifact that is not a function of its stated input is not generated. It is
collected.** That is the same class as P19 and as the duplicate `results/sizing.json` that
`motor_model.py`'s header records: a second copy of something, produced by a path nobody
declared, that then disagrees with the original.

**Fixed:** `copy()` now filters against `git ls-files`, so nothing untracked can enter a
companion, and the export **names every path it skipped** rather than silently dropping it. On a
clean clone the filter is a byte-for-byte no-op, which was verified rather than assumed — and it
was verified to fire, by planting an untracked `plate_clamped.frd` and confirming it was excluded
and reported.

**What this does not fix, and it is the part worth arguing about.** `validation/README.md`'s own
conventions say to *"commit input decks and result JSON, never vendored solver code"* — and the
A4 decks are **not committed**. So the correct end state is probably that `plate*.inp` belongs in
the flagship and the solver output does not, rather than that all of it disappears. **The
companions have lost the input decks in this regeneration**, and they were the only published
copy. Recorded here rather than quietly restored, because restoring them means committing them to
the flagship first, and that is a decision about what the repository tracks.

**The decision was taken, and it is already in `.gitignore`.** `validation/fea/*.inp`, `*.dat`,
`*.frd`, `*.sta`, `*.cvg` and `*.log` are ignored, under the comment *"decks are regenerated by
`validation/fea/build_deck.py`"* — which **is** tracked. A deck is an output of a committed
generator, so the repository holds the generator and not the deck, exactly as it does for
`cad/`, `validation/fem3d/` and `validation/cfd/`. **The original criterion:** decide whether
`validation/fea/plate*.inp` belongs in the flagship. If
it does, commit the decks — `build_deck.py` regenerates them and needs only `gmsh` — and the next
export republishes them with real provenance. If it does not, `validation/README.md`'s convention
about committing input decks should say so. **Either answer closes this; the current state
answers it by accident**, which is what made the leak possible.

### P40. The repositioning cost was stated at half its real value, in the ADR that adopted the ConOps: MEDIUM, NEW 2026-08-10
> **Status:** `CORRECTED` — found, fixed and propagated. Retained as the published record


**Corrected.** Same day, 2026-08-10, by the band that caught it.

`docs/CONCEPT.md` §4 and **ADR-024** both stated altitude repositioning at *"~14 m/s per Hohmann
leg"* and called it cheap. **A 50 km shell change is a two-burn transfer costing 27.82 m/s** —
13.92 m/s on the first burn and 13.90 m/s on the second. **14 m/s is one burn. The quantity is
two.**

**Found by A20 band 1 failing**, which is the only reason it was found at all. The band was
declared at 10–20 m/s against a row explicitly naming a two-burn Hohmann, so the band carried the
same error as the documents and **failed against the correct answer**. It is recorded as a
failure and **was not widened**.

**This is the A15 band 2 error repeating**: a band whose named quantity and whose stated limit
describe different things. There it was apogee spread against altitude extent; here it is one
burn against two. **Both times the error was in the band, not the model, and both times the run
is what exposed it.**

**What it changes.** Repositioning is not cheap. At 100 m/s of host budget the stage reaches four
shells rather than the seven the halved figure implied, and the propellant bill is a real
constraint against a budget nobody has disclosed (**E5**) rather than a rounding item. The
delivery claim in `CONCEPT.md` survives — A20 bands 2 and 3 both pass — but it survives at twice
the stated price.

**Why this is numbered under the freeze.** [ADR-021](docs/adr/021-freeze-the-register.md) admits
two of the three categories here at once: it is a defect that made a published Phase I deliverable
wrong, and it is a validation band miss. Both were live within hours of each other.

**Found by A23 band 3**, which was declared as a `REPORT` row precisely because nobody knew what
it would return.

**The payload CoM sits 70 mm off the thrust line**, so the 413.2 N push produces a **28.92 N·m**
moment about it and an angular acceleration of **688 rad/s²** if the payload is free to rotate.
The cradle holds it **with clearance**. It is therefore not free for long — but it is free for
long enough:

| Cradle clearance | Time to cross | **Arrival rate** | vs the 2 °/s tip-off band |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 0.05 mm | 0.92 ms | **36.5 °/s** | **18×** |
| 0.50 mm | 2.92 ms | **115.3 °/s** | **58×** |
| 2.00 mm | 5.84 ms | **230.6 °/s** | **115×** |

**No clearance in that range is benign**, including one tighter than the sled's own 0.05 mm
gap-shim tolerance.

**Two consequences, and the second is worse than the first.**

1. **It is an unsized load case.** The payload arrives with rotational energy into its own CDS
   corner rails, twelve times per campaign, and nothing in this repository has sized the rails,
   the cradle or the seat for it.
2. **It may set the tip-off rate instead of the release mechanism.** After impact the payload
   rebounds, re-crosses the gap and rattles. **Whether that has settled by release, 158 ms later,
   depends on a restitution and damping model this project does not have.** If it has not, tip-off
   is governed by a rattle at 18–115× the band rather than by the mechanism A23 specified.

**Tightening the clearance does not fix it.** Arrival rate goes as √(clearance), so a factor of
ten tighter buys √10 — 115 °/s becomes 36 °/s, still 18× the band.

**What closed it, written before A34 ran:** **preload the cradle** so there is no gap to accelerate across. A23 band
4 measured the couple reaction the preload must exceed at **85.0 N per contact**, which is modest
and achievable. The alternative is geometric — A23 band 5 prices it — and needs the CoM offset
cut from **70 mm to 3.5 mm**, which is aligning the payload CoM with the thrust line rather than
trimming it. **Preload is the cheap route and the redesign is the expensive one.**

**This is analysis only.** The rattle question is exactly what the multibody run **A7** was
specified for and has never had, and **T-5** is the test that would settle it on hardware.

### P42. The public site served superseded numbers for a week, and nothing was watching it: MEDIUM, NEW 2026-08-10
> **Status:** `CORRECTED` — found, fixed and propagated. Retained as the published record


**Corrected.** 2026-08-10, and the guard that would have caught it is added in the same pass.

`docs/index.html` is the GitHub Pages site — **the most public artifact this project has**, and
the first thing anyone following a link sees. It carried the **pre-quadrature operating point**:

| Quantity | Site said | Correct since 2026-08-03 |
|---|---|---|
| Thrust constant | 11.22 N/kA·m, ±1.26 % | **11.03, ±0.99 %** |
| Exit velocity | 16.54 m/s at 10.7 g | **16.388 m/s at 10.53 g** |
| Net efficiency | 21.2 % | **20.99 %** |
| Dry / loaded mass | 76.9 / 124.9 kg | **76.5 / 124.5 kg** |
| Recoil per shot | 66.1 N·s | **65.6 N·s** |

**Seven days of a public page contradicting the repository's own baseline.**

**Its validation section was worse than stale — it was wrong about the project's own record.** It
said *"Three have now been run, and one of the three failed"* and listed A1, A6 and A7 as
"specified", against an actual **19 of 21 run**. A reader judging this project on its evidence
discipline was being shown a two-month-old snapshot of it.

**The cause is the one P38 already named, in a place nobody had checked.**
`tools/check_artifacts.py` guarded the paper PDF, the CV, `BASELINE.md` and the figures against
their sources. **It did not guard the website**, so the website was the one published artifact
with no tie to the numbers it quotes. P38 recorded that *"nothing catches a source older than its
own validation result"*; this is the same gap one layer out — nothing caught an **artifact** older
than its own **source**, for the one artifact that was not in the list.

**Fixed:** `docs/index.html` is now a guarded artifact of `motor_results.json`,
`mass_properties.json` and `astro_results.json`. It fired immediately on a 70-hour drift, which is
the check doing exactly what it exists for.

**What is not fixed, and is the honest remainder.** The site is **hand-authored HTML**, so the
guard can only detect drift, not prevent it — unlike `BASELINE.md`, which is *generated* and
therefore cannot drift at all. **The durable fix is to generate the headline table from
`analysis/results/*.json`** the way `make_baseline.py` does. That is not done, and until it is,
this failure mode is detectable rather than impossible.

**And the fix did not reach every surface. Found 2026-08-10, while replacing the renders.**
The **GitHub wiki** — a third public surface, and one nothing in this repository had ever
compared against anything — was serving the same pre-quadrature operating point the site was
(**11.22 N/kA·m, 16.54 m/s at 10.7 g, 19 % efficiency, 76.9/124.9 kg, 66.1 N·s**), plus the
render set withdrawn under P43, plus a repository link still reading `aaaaaaaaaaaavm/emocd`
under the old project name.

`wiki/Home.md` **in this repository is correct** and has been for a week; the live wiki is a
*separate git repository* (`VOLLEY.wiki.git`) that nothing syncs it to. So the flagship's copy
being right was never evidence that the wiki was, and `check_artifacts.py` cannot help: the
artifact it would guard is not in this repository at all.

**This is not closed.** The corrected page cannot be pushed from the working environment — a
wiki is not addressable as a repository through the GitHub API, so the credential proxy refuses
it. **Until `wiki/Home.md` is copied into the live wiki by hand, the wiki still publishes
superseded numbers.** That is the one part of P42 that remains outstanding, and it is recorded
here rather than left to be rediscovered.

### P43. The renders on the front page showed the satellite being fired into its own host: HIGH, NEW 2026-08-10
> **Status:** `CORRECTED` — found, fixed and propagated. Retained as the published record
> a provenance gap of its own, recorded below and not hidden


**Corrected.** 2026-08-10. Found by inspection of the render set, not by any check.

`cad/renders/seq2_midstroke.png` and `cad/renders/seq3_release.png` — used in `README.md`, on
the Pages site and in the wiki, three of the four surfaces a stranger sees first — showed the
payload **departing through the ESPA mounting flange**: the face that bolts to the host. They
also drew the CubeSat as a **wheeled road vehicle**, a sample-asset placeholder that was never
replaced.

**This is worse than a cosmetic defect, because the geometry is the argument.** The entire
interface case rests on the payload leaving along the track axis, out the muzzle, away from the
host. A reader taking those frames at face value would conclude the machine fires backwards into
the vehicle it is bolted to — and would be right to stop reading. The images had been the
project's most-viewed artifact for the whole time they were wrong.

**Cause.** The renders were produced as illustration and were never checked against the
requirement they illustrate. Nothing in `tools/` looks at an image, so no check could have caught
it; `check_artifacts.py` guards numbers against their sources and has no notion of a picture
being wrong about the thing it depicts. The render brief in `cad/FUSION_RENDER_BRIEF.md` was
written *after* the defective set existed, which is why it now specifies the departure direction
explicitly.

**Fixed.** The seven-shot Gen4 set replaces them: `hero_open`, `espa_interface`, `track_stator`,
`brake`, `sled_detail`, `envelope_closed`, `magazine_feed`. In every one the payload leaves along
the track axis, away from the flange, and each carries a drawn departure arrow so the direction is
stated rather than merely happening to be right. `cad/tools/prepare_renders.py` regenerates the
published set from the uncropped frames in `cad/renders/source/`. Only `exploded_view.png` is
retained from Gen3, because Gen4 has no equivalent shot, and it is labelled as Gen3 wherever it
appears.

**The honest remainder, and it is not small.**

1. **Gen4 has no committed STEP export** (ADR-019, `docs/GEN4_STATUS.md`), so the published
   renders now show geometry that **no file in `cad/step/` matches**. The repository trades a
   set that was wrong about physics for a set that is right about physics and unverifiable
   against a committed model. That trade is deliberate — a reader misled about the deployment
   direction is worse off than one told the picture is ahead of the export — but it is a trade,
   and it stands until the Gen4 export gate opens or Gen5 supersedes it.
2. **Gen4's stations are not the analysis model's.** Gen4 releases at s = 1200 mm over a 900 mm
   stroke; `analysis/` assumes release at 1500 mm over 1.5 m. P39 already holds this. Every
   caption on every surface has therefore been stripped of performance figures, and each states
   that no number is taken from Gen4.
3. **The payload is still a plain rectangular proxy**, not a modelled 3U satellite. Correct in
   its envelope and its direction of travel, and nothing more than that.
4. **No check exists that would catch the next one.** An image cannot be diffed against a
   requirement by anything currently in `tools/`. The renders remain the one class of published
   artifact with no automated tie to the repository's own claims — the same shape of gap as P42,
   one layer further out, and this time with no fix proposed because none is cheap.

### P44. At femtosat scale the separation hardware outweighs the satellites it separates: MEDIUM, NEW 2026-08-10
> **Status:** `LIVE` — open engineering; something still has to be done


**A24 band 6 miss, 2026-08-10.** Declared ≤ 0.5 % of exit velocity, measured **0.508 %**.
The band is not widened; see `validation/README.md`.

The fixed-cell manifest (ADR-025) puts several satellites in one cell, and everything in a cell
leaves on the same shot at the same commanded velocity — so **cell-mates have a designed
differential of exactly zero and never separate from each other.** A24 band 6 tested the obvious
mechanism: a compressed shim at each internal interface, momentum-neutral because it pushes
cell-mates against each other rather than against the sled.

**It works for every class except the smallest, and there it inverts.**

| Class | Per cell | Payload in the cell | Shim hardware | Mean shift |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **ChipSat / femtosat** | 720 | 3.600 kg | **7.190 kg** | **0.0832 m/s, 0.508 %** |
| PocketQube 1P | 24 | 6.000 kg | 0.230 kg | 0.010 % |
| 1U CubeSat | 3 | 3.990 kg | 0.020 kg | 0.001 % |

**720 ChipSats need 719 interfaces. At 10 g each that is 7.19 kg of separation hardware to
disperse 3.6 kg of satellites** — twice the mass of everything it exists to act on. It also stops
being momentum-neutral, because that mass leaves with one side of each interface, which is the
term the band actually caught.

**The 10 g shim is an assumption**, carried explicitly in `cell_manifest.py` and not sourced.
A lighter interface moves the number; nothing plausible moves it by the factor needed, because
the ratio is set by count, not by mass — 719 of anything is heavy next to 3.6 kg.

**ChipSat was already outside the mechanism's declared limit.** `payload_family.py` flags
anything above 200 per load as "a different machine, not a bigger magazine", and 8640 is 43× that.
**This does not rescue the band**, which was declared over every class sharing a cell, before the
script existed, and which one class missed.

**What would close it.** Not a lighter shim. The requirement itself is wrong at this scale:
8640 femtosats do not want 10 m of pairwise separation within 120 s, they want a **designed
dispersion across a swarm** — a distribution of velocities produced once, at cell level, rather
than an interface between every pair. That is a different mechanism with a different acceptance
argument, and it is **PII-13**. Until it exists, **the fixed-cell architecture is qualified for
PocketQube 1P and above, and is not qualified for ChipSat/femtosat.**

### P45. The flywheel buys the impedance and pays it back in mass: LOW, NEW 2026-08-10
> **Status:** `LIVE` — open engineering; something still has to be done


**A25 band 4 miss, 2026-08-10.** Declared ≤ the 3-string bank it replaces (19.5 kg), measured
**20.61 kg** — over by **1.11 kg**. The band is not widened; see `validation/README.md`.

A25 tested a flywheel motor-generator against **P26**, the supercapacitor bank that cannot source
the shot. **Band 6, the reason the analysis exists, passed decisively**: 35 mΩ series resistance
against A10's 68 mΩ ceiling, delivering 66 kW against 32.5 kW required. The impedance problem is
solved and the coupling that made P26 poisonous — the ceiling tightening as velocity rises — is
broken.

**It is not free.** The store lands at **mass parity**, not a saving:

| | Mass |
|---|---:|
| Motor-generators (the dominant term) | **9.76 kg** |
| Rotors + containment, counter-rotating pair | 6.00 kg |
| Bearings + converter | 4.85 kg |
| **Total** | **20.61 kg** vs a 19.50 kg bank |

**The miss is owned by a single unsourced assumption.** `MG_KG_PER_KW = 0.30` is an engineering
estimate for a high-speed PM machine with no datasheet behind it. At **0.25 the band passes**; at
0.20 it passes by 2.1 kg. And against the **four-string** bank that
`docs/DESIGN_OPTIONS_exit_velocity.md` calls the configuration "with margin", the flywheel wins at
every value tested, by **5.4 to 10.3 kg**.

**Two independent things would close this**, and neither is analysis:

1. **A real specific-mass figure for a 16 kW high-speed PM machine.** One datasheet decides the
   band. This is the same class of gap as E3 (no vendor quotations anywhere in this project) and
   is the cheapest thing on this list to close.
2. **Deciding whether the comparator is three strings or four.** The repository currently says
   both — 3 in the ESR table, "4 with margin" in the same paragraph. Against four, the flywheel
   already wins and this entry would not exist.

**What this does not settle, and is the real risk.** Bearings for a multi-thousand-rpm rotor in
vacuum across a multi-year mission are not designed here, and are a more credible route to
rejecting the flywheel than mass ever was. Neither is the launch restraint for a rotor. Band 5's
0.175 N·m·s residual also assumes the controller holds two rotors to **1 % speed match**, against
a single-rotor store of 17.5 N·m·s — five times the shot disturbance it sits beside.

### E29. Nothing computes the shot's angular impulse about the host, and a reaction wheel saturates in about four shots: NEW 2026-08-10
> **Status:** `LIVE` — open engineering; something still has to be done


**Found 2026-08-10 while pricing momentum management, not by any check.**

`analysis/astro.py` models the host interaction as one line:

```python
res['recoil_Ns_per_shot'] = round(4.0 * DV, 1)
```

**That is linear momentum only.** A13 covers the *indexing* and *sled-return* disturbance —
0.44 °/s peak and a 1.37° attitude offset on a 200 kg host — but **nothing anywhere computes the
angular impulse the shot itself delivers about the host's centre of mass**, which is the term
that decides whether the host can hold attitude across a campaign at all.

**The linear part is mostly a non-problem, and should be said so plainly:**

| Host | Δv per shot | Campaign, 12 shots | Orbit change |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 200 kg | 0.328 m/s | 3.93 m/s | −14 km |
| **2000 kg spent stage** | 0.033 m/s | **0.393 m/s** | **−1.4 km** |

On the ConOps ADR-024 adopted it is noise, and it is retrograde — the direction a stage wants for
disposal. **No flywheel, reaction wheel or CMG can cancel it anyway**: those store *angular*
momentum, and linear momentum in a closed system has three exits only — expel propellant, accept
the Δv, or fire something the other way.

**The angular part is the severe one and it is unmodelled:**

| Thrust line misses host CoM by | H per shot | Campaign | vs a 15 N·m·s ESPA-class wheel |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 50 mm | 3.28 N·m·s | 39.3 | **2.6× saturated** |
| 250 mm | 16.39 N·m·s | 196.7 | 13× saturated |
| 500 mm | 32.78 N·m·s | 393.3 | 26× saturated |

**A wheel saturates around shot four at a 50 mm offset.** Desaturating 393 N·m·s needs thrusters,
which is the OTV this project exists not to be, or magnetorquers, which are orders of magnitude
short in any useful time. Bigger wheels do not help and CMGs do not help: the constraint is
momentum **storage**, not torque.

**There is no interface requirement anywhere in this repository that the thrust line pass through
the host centre of mass.** [ADR-010](docs/adr/010-host-agnostic-interface.md) specifies the mount
host-agnostically and `docs/PAYLOAD_ENVIRONMENT.md` covers the inward-facing half, but neither
states a permissible thrust-line-to-CoM offset. That absence is the defect: the cheapest fix by orders of magnitude attacks the moment arm rather
than the momentum, and it is currently nobody's requirement.

**The related lever, and it is the highest-leverage geometric number in the machine.**
`cad/parameters.json` carries `payload_com_offset_above_thrust_line = 70 mm`. That single number
drives **three separate open problems**:

1. **tip-off** — A23's 36–231 °/s cradle arrival, and the 2 °/s release band;
2. **this entry** — the angular impulse, via the payload's 413 N reacting 70 mm off-axis;
3. **track bending stiffness** — the same couple is the 96 N transverse load that sets the
   track's EI requirement, which scales as L³ and is what makes any longer track expensive
   (PII-11, PII-14).

Driving it toward zero is **cradle geometry, not new hardware, and not an architecture change**.

**What would close it:** a rigid-body angular-momentum budget for the shot over a campaign,
against a named host inertia and a stated CoM tolerance, with bands declared first — and an
interface requirement, in ADR-010's successor or an amendment to it, stating the permissible
thrust-line-to-CoM offset, which is the number the budget exists to set. Neither exists.

### P46. K_t is a centre-plane value and overstates thrust by 4.42 %: CORRECTED 2026-08-13
> **Status:** `LIVE` — open engineering; something still has to be done
> **Corrected.** Applied 2026-08-13, three days after being computed and held. `thrust_constant()`
> now Gauss-Legendre averages `B_y` over z ∈ [−45, +45] mm before the Lorentz sum, which is a
> change to the physics rather than a pasted factor (ADR-015). **K_t 11.0258 → 10.5386, ratio
> 0.9558 — exactly A2 band 2's measurement — and v_exit 16.388 → 16.029 m/s.** `nz = 1`
> reproduces the superseded value exactly, so A2's ratio stays checkable. Propagated across 214
> occurrences in 37 live documents by `tools/propagate_baseline.py`, with the audit record
> excluded by construction. **ADR-030.**

**Found by A2, 2026-08-10.** The correction is **computed and held, not applied.** See below.

`motor_model.build_field()` has always used magpylib `Cuboid` sources with the real **90 mm
depth**, so the field was never two-dimensional. **The two-dimensional assumption is in the
thrust integral**, which samples `B_y` on the centre plane z = 0 and then multiplies by the full
depth as though that value held across all 90 mm:

```python
By = field.getB(np.stack([X.ravel(), Y.ravel(), np.zeros(X.size)], 1))[:, 1]
...
return float((...).sum() * dx * (WIND_THICK / 2) * DEPTH)
```

It does not hold. The field falls off toward the array's z-edges.

| | K_t, N per kA·m |
|---|---:|
| Centre-plane — reproduces the published value to 0.000 % | **11.0258** |
| **Depth-resolved**, Gauss-Legendre over z ∈ [−45, +45] mm | **10.5386** |
| Ratio | **0.9558** |

**A2 band 2 was declared at ≥ 0.95 and this passes by 0.008.** The model is inside the tolerance
that was declared for it, which is why this is a defect rather than a band miss. **But the better
number is now known, and it is 4.42 % lower.**

**What it moves, computed through `motor_model.shot()` with nothing else changed:**

| | Published | Depth-resolved |
|---|---:|---:|
| K_t | 11.0258 N/kA·m | **10.5386** |
| **v_exit** | **16.388 m/s** | **16.029 m/s** (−2.19 %) |
| Acceleration | 10.53 g | 10.07 g |
| Peak current | 339 A | 320 A |
| Stroke time | 158.6 ms | 162.3 ms |

**Why it has not been applied.** `docs/BASELINE.md` fixes K_t and v_exit, and every published
number in the repository, the paper and the CV descends from them. A re-baseline is a change-
control action with its own propagation pass across `BASELINE.md`, `paper.tex`, `docs/index.html`,
`SUMMARY.md`, the wiki, the companions and 23 guarded baseline values — **not something a
validation run does to itself.** The correction is recorded here, computed, reproducible from
`analysis/field_3d.py`, and waiting on that decision.

**What would close it:** either the propagation pass, or a decision that the centre-plane value
is retained deliberately as a stated approximation with its 4.42 % error quoted alongside it.
**Both are defensible; leaving the two numbers coexisting silently is not.**

**And the correction is probably not final.** A2 band 4 — an independent `getdp` 3-D FEM
cross-check — **was not run**, so 10.5386 is still magpylib, which is analytic superposition.
E2's objection that nothing here *solves a field equation* in 3-D stands. Re-baselining onto a
number that a different method has never checked would repeat the mistake this entry is about,
one level down.

### P47. The published velocity-loop gain is linearly unstable, and its numeric value is a bandwidth: HIGH, CORRECTED 2026-08-13
> **Status:** `CORRECTED` — found, fixed and propagated. Retained as the published record


**Found by A28, 2026-08-13, on bands declared at `3ae36ad` before the script existed.** Raised in
external review as an essential missing piece of work, and the review was right.

`motor_model.closed_loop_mc()` carried **proportional velocity feedback at a gain of 3500**, with
no plant model, no transfer function, no margin, no controller rate, no sensor dynamics, and no
check against the track's modes. Four of A28's six bands failed.

**The controller is feedback-linearised.** It divides the command by the modelled thrust constant
and multiplies by the modelled mass, so the plant's own K_t/m cancels and the loop transfer is
`L(s) = Kp/s · exp(−sτ)`. **Kp is not a current gain — it is an acceleration per unit velocity
error, in s⁻¹, and its numeric value is the gain crossover in rad/s.** 3500 s⁻¹ is a crossover at
**557 Hz**. That was never stated anywhere, and read as a current gain the number looks harmless.

| At Kp = 3500 s⁻¹, τ = 0.700 ms | | Band |
|---|---:|---|
| Gain crossover | 557.0 Hz | — |
| Phase margin | **−50.4°** | ≥ 45° |
| Gain margin | **−3.86 dB** | ≥ 6 dB |
| Closed-loop bandwidth | **671.0 Hz** | ≤ 36.3 Hz |
| Stroke with command above rating | **29.7 %** | ≤ 5 % |

**Two things made this invisible for as long as it was.** `closed_loop_mc` feeds back the
*undelayed* state, so its loop sits at zero latency, where 3500 does hold +69.9° of phase margin;
the published gain is marginally stable at a total lag of **449 µs** and no real sensor is that
fast. And the command is clipped to `[0, K_RATED]`, which turns a linearly unstable loop into a
bang-bang relay whose mean follows the feedforward term, with the terminal ±0.3 m/s photogate trim
removing the residual. **The dispersion figure was dominated by the saturation limits and the
terminal correction, not by the feedback it was attributed to.**

**Corrected.** `motor_model.KP_VELOCITY = 195` s⁻¹ — `design_gain()` returns 195.2 s⁻¹ as the
largest gain holding ≥ 50° of phase margin at 0.6 ms *and* bandwidth at or below a third of the
109 Hz first mode; the implemented value is rounded down to sit at or below it. Result: PM
**+82.2°**, GM **+21.2 dB**, bandwidth **36.3 Hz**, **0.0 %** of the stroke above rating.

**The gain falls 18× and the dispersion does not move**: 0.0271 → **0.0267 m/s**, both 0.027 to
two significant figures. The loop never needed the bandwidth; the dispersion is set by the
terminal trim and by the K_t and mass tolerances.

**Baseline change under rules 1 and 2** of `docs/BASELINE.md`. Only the dispersion row moved.
**K_t stays 11.0258 N/kA·m and v_exit stays 16.388 m/s** — neither depends on the controller.
**Validations invalidated: none**; nothing else reads `closed_loop_mc`.

**Two limits belong to other entries, not to this one:** the plant is rigid, so the 48 Hz and
109 Hz modes appear as a frequency the bandwidth is held away from rather than as a compliant
model in the loop (**P36**); and the delay is a stated assumption, because no sensor has been
selected (**E7**).

### P48. Two A29 bands failed, and neither failure is in the machine: LOW, NEW 2026-08-13
> **Status:** `CORRECTED` — found, fixed and propagated. Retained as the published record


**Found by A29, 2026-08-13**, on bands declared at `949fdf4` before `validation/cfd/` existed.
Numbered under [ADR-021](docs/adr/021-freeze-the-register.md) case 3: **a missed band produces a
numbered defect, never a widened band.**

**Band 2 — drag coefficient in 0.7 ≤ C_d ≤ 2.5. Result 0.523.**

The floor of 0.7 came from a rectangular bluff body normal to the flow, which sits near 1.05–1.2.
**The assembly is a stepped body, not a solid one:** the 3U payload leads with a 100 × 100 mm
face and the sled behind it is 172 × 140 mm, so a large part of the reference frontal area lies
in the payload's own wake. A coefficient referenced to a partly shadowed area is below the
textbook value for the shape the band compared it against.

**Band 1 settles that this is not a mesh artefact:** 6.3× the cells (92,774 → 581,779) moves
C_d by **4.86 %**, to 0.5497 — still far below the 0.7 floor. Refining does not recover the
missing drag. Three further checks say the solve is sound: peak C_p on the body is **0.975**
where stagnation should approach 1.000; the meshed wetted area is **0.4173 m² of 0.5612 m²** of raw STL, the difference
being the interior payload–sled interface; and the drag splits as forward faces **+0.233**, base
suction **+0.156**, sides **+0.001**, which is the classic bluff-body signature.

**Band 5 — the stator channel raises C_d by ≥ 10 %. Result −12.7 %.**

The plates **lower** drag, from 0.523 to 0.457, and tighten the spread from ±8.3 % to ±3.5 %.
The plate sits in the mid-plane the sled straddles and is acting as a **splitter**, not a wall —
a splitter plate in the near wake suppresses wake oscillation and raises base pressure, which is
what the tighter spread reports. **The consequence is useful: the free-stream figure is the
conservative one**, so the ground-test correction is quoted from the free case.

**Corrected.** What changes is the practice, not a number: no result moved and no band was edited.
**A drag band must name its reference area and the shape it is being compared against**, because
a drag coefficient without its reference area is not a number. This is the same class as A2's
band 3, which passed while measuring numerical cancellation on a symmetry axis: **a band can be
satisfiable and still be the wrong question.**

### P49. A Gen6 proposal was sized on an assumption wrong by 22x, and the band declared to kill it did: CORRECTED 2026-08-13
> **Status:** `CORRECTED` — found, fixed and propagated. Retained as the published record


**Found by A30 band 1, 2026-08-13**, on bands declared at `7df75ac` before
`analysis/edge_effect.py` existed. Numbered under [ADR-021](docs/adr/021-freeze-the-register.md)
case 3.

**PII-16 proposed driving a linear induction motor on the CubeSat Design Specification's own
aluminium corner rails** — the interface every deployer already touches, on every satellite,
requiring nothing to be added. `analysis/rail_drive.py` sized it at **513 N, 18.26 m/s on 1182 J**
and it looked better than Gen5 on every axis.

**It rested on a transverse edge-effect derating assumed at 0.55.** The file declared that at the
top as its dominant assumption; `docs/GEN6_RAIL_DRIVE.md` named 0.20 as the value at which the
idea would be dead. **The measured figure is 0.0253.**

| | |
|---|---:|
| Assumed | 0.55 |
| **Measured** | **0.0253** |
| Thrust, four rails at a generous 0.60 T | **41.9 N** |
| Required to reproduce Gen5's 10.5 g on a 3U | 413 N |

**No pole pitch rescues it**, and the reason is a contradiction rather than a shortfall: the edge
factor wants the secondary wide against the pole pitch, the airgap wants the pole pitch large
against the gap, and an 8.5 mm conductor in a 10.5 mm effective gap demands both at once. For a
narrow secondary the factor collapses as **(πc/τ)²/3** — quadratically, not gradually.

**Band 2 caught a bug in the solver before any of that was read off it.** The first run returned
**exactly 0.0000 for every geometry**, including one Russell–Norsworthy puts at 0.66. The imposed
field had been written as a real `cos(kx)`, which puts the stream function 90° out of phase and
integrates the thrust to zero for every width. With the travelling wave carried as a phasor the
solver agrees with the closed form to **1.0 %**. Fourth time a declared band has caught a defect
in an analysis rather than in the design; second time a solver has returned identically zero and
reported success.

**Corrected.** `rail_drive.py`'s `EDGE` is set to the measured 0.0253, so the file now reports
the rejection instead of the proposal, with the original assumption recorded rather than deleted.
`docs/GEN6_RAIL_DRIVE.md` carries a rejection header. **Nothing in Gen5 was ever changed on the
strength of the proposal**, which is why this is a corrected defect and not a baseline event.

**What survives, and it is the reason band 4 was declared in advance.** The same solver puts a
**90 mm flat plate** — the widest that fits inside a 3U's own section — at **0.6691**, 26× the
rail, making **1652 N at only 0.45 T** for **0.248 kg** of aluminium. **The drive is sound; the
rail is the wrong conductor.** Those are different findings and the band structure exists to keep
them apart.

### P50. The plate drive's thrust was quoted at the magnetic-pressure ceiling, and it reaches 23 % of it: CORRECTED 2026-08-13
> **Status:** `CORRECTED` — found, fixed and propagated. Retained as the published record


**Found by A31 band 5, 2026-08-13**, on bands declared at `f3b73d6` before
`analysis/plate_normal_force.py` existed. The figure has been corrected wherever it appeared and
propagated.

`validation/A30_rail_drive.md` reported that a 90 mm × 340 mm × 3 mm aluminium plate makes
**1652 N at 0.45 T**, obtained by taking the magnetic-pressure ceiling **B²/2μ₀** and applying
A30's measured edge factor. **A layered-media solve of the actual double-sided geometry gives
378 N** — a factor of **4.4**.

| | |
|---|---:|
| Quoted in A30 | 1652 N |
| **A31, layered solve, same 0.45 T and same geometry** | **378 N** |
| Fraction of the magnetic-pressure ceiling actually reached | **22.9 %** |

**The ceiling is not reached because the gap is not zero.** B²/2μ₀ is the ideal thin-sheet limit;
with a 7 mm magnetic gap against a 48 mm pole pitch the field decays across the gap and the
coupling falls well short of it. The error was to treat a bound as an estimate.

**A30 band 4 is unaffected** — the edge factor is 0.6691 and that is a separate measurement, made
with a separate solver, and it still stands.

**Corrected in place, and the architecture still closes.** A31's design sweep puts the best point inside
the 25 g payload qualification cap at **900 N, 21.6 g, 23.48 m/s** at 0.75 T, and a conservative
**671 N, 16.1 g, 20.26 m/s** at 0.60 T — both on the same 0.248 kg plate, against Gen5's
16.39 m/s from a 9.445 kg sled. **What changes is the flux density the stator has to produce**,
from 0.45 T to 0.60–0.75 T, which is inside what an iron-cored stator gives.

**Band 5 also caught two structural faults in the solver before any of this was readable.** The
first run returned **705 % of the magnetic-pressure ceiling**: the model had one current sheet
and a flux return, which is a single-sided machine rather than the double-sided one being
designed; and the flux density was normalised on the **screened** field at the plate instead of
the **open-gap** field. Fifth time a declared band has caught a defect in an analysis rather than
in the design, and the second time in one day.

### P51. An A32 band tested a ratio where it should have tested an excursion: CORRECTED 2026-08-13
> **Status:** `CORRECTED` — found, fixed and propagated. Retained as the published record


**Found by A32 band 3, 2026-08-13**, on bands declared at `0635b5c` before
`analysis/entry_transient.py` existed. Numbered under
[ADR-021](docs/adr/021-freeze-the-register.md) case 3.

Band 3 required the transverse force on the plate during the entry transient not to exceed its
own steady-state value. **It peaks at 2.73×.** But it never changes sign — it is **restoring
throughout**, and the overshoot is *toward* centre.

| | |
|---|---:|
| Steady-state transverse force at 0.5 mm offset | **0.824 N** |
| Thrust at the same point | 611 N |
| Transient peak | **~2.25 N**, for about 6 ms |

**The band asked the wrong question.** What decides whether the plate touches a stator is the
**excursion** across its 2 mm clearance, not a ratio to a steady state it is transiently
overshooting. As written, the band fails on a harmless over-restoring transient and **would have
passed a genuinely destabilising force that happened to be smaller than its own steady state.**

**Corrected.** The change is to the practice, not to a number: no result moved and no band
was edited. **A
stability band must be on the excursion or on the absolute force.** Same class as A2 band 3,
which passed while measuring numerical cancellation on a symmetry axis: **a band can be
well-formed, falsifiable, and still not be the question.**

### P52. The segmented stator puts a 30 % force ripple through the track's first mode: HIGH, NEW 2026-08-13
> **Status:** `LIVE` — open engineering; something still has to be done


**Found by A32 band 4, 2026-08-13.** This one is in the machine.

Thrust ripple as the plate crosses a segment boundary is **30.1 % peak-to-peak** against a 20 %
band. **It is not the joint gap:** closing the unenergised gap from 10 mm to zero leaves **25 %**.
The cause is the **longitudinal truncation of the travelling field** at the edge of an energised
section — the end effect of a segmented long stator with a short secondary, intrinsic to the
topology rather than to the joint.

**Why it matters.** With four segments over the 1.30 m acceleration zone, the segment-crossing
frequency sweeps **0 → 61.5 Hz** across the stroke, and `analysis/sizing.py` puts the track's
first two modes at **48 Hz and 109 Hz**. A 30 % force disturbance sweeping through 48 Hz is
**A17's force-ripple chirp in a new place**, and **P36** already records that the track has no
dynamic design case. It cannot be assumed clear.

**What would close it.** Energising **overlapping** segments so the field under the plate is
never truncated is the obvious candidate and is not computed. Longer segments lower the crossing
frequency without removing the truncation. Either way this is a drive-and-track question that has
to be answered before the plate architecture is adopted, and it is the first item found in three
sheets that is a defect in the *machine* rather than in an analysis.

### P53. The 2026-08-13 baseline change reached the documents and not the scripts: CRITICAL, NEW 2026-08-14
> **Status:** `CORRECTED` — found, fixed and propagated. Retained as the published record

**Found by a consistency sweep, 2026-08-14.** [ADR-030](docs/adr/030-apply-the-depth-resolved-thrust-constant.md)
moved the rated shot from 16.388 to **16.029 m/s**. `tools/propagate_baseline.py` carried that
through the prose, and `sizing.py` and `motor_model.py` were edited by hand. **Eight other
analysis scripts were not**, because the propagation tool walks `.md` and `.html` only and a
number pasted into a `.py` is invisible to it:

| Script | What it carried | What it fed |
|---|---|---|
| `astro.py` | `DV = 16.388` | **every astrodynamic headline in the repository** |
| `attitude_budget.py` | `V_EXIT = 16.388` | recoil and campaign impulse |
| `actuator_trade.py` | `V = 16.388` | the whole A27 trade |
| `cell_manifest.py` | `V_EXIT_3U = 16.388` | A24 bands 5 and 6 |

**And one more, of a different kind:** `payload_family.py` carried `DEPLOYER_DRY_KG = 76.5`
under a comment reading *"mass_properties.json"*. Dry mass had moved to **84.5 kg**. So
kg-per-satellite — **kill criterion 1's entire subject** — was computed **8 kg light** while the
documents carried the corrected 7.042. A comment claiming a source is not reading the source.

**What moved when they were re-run.**

| Quantity | Published | Correct |
|---|---|---|
| Orbital lifetime multiplier | ×1.62 | **×1.60** |
| Lifetime extension | +61.8 % | **+60.2 %** |
| Lifetime ratio, fastest spring | 7.52× | **7.33×** |
| Velocity ratio, fastest spring | 6.6× | **6.4×** |
| Recoil per shot | 65.6 N·s | **64.1 N·s** |
| Campaign impulse | 0.787 kN·s | **0.769 kN·s** |
| Cold-gas mass loss at 3U | 7.5× | **8.3×** |
| Conjunction minimum | 54.9 km | **42.2 km** |

**No band verdict changed except A24 band 1** (**P54**). Every direction is unfavourable, which
is the expected sign: the correction lowered the velocity and raised the mass.

**Corrected.** No script holds a literal operating point any more. `motor_model.operating_point()`
is the single source and the eight callers read it; `payload_family.py` reads
`mass_properties.json`. A literal cannot fork if there is no literal.

**What this does not fix.** `tools/propagate_baseline.py` still walks `.md` and `.html` only. The
repair here removes the *literals it could not see*, rather than teaching it to see them — which
is the stronger fix, but only for the values that were de-forked.

### P54. A24 band 1 fails against a reference literal that has since been corrected: MEDIUM, NEW 2026-08-14
> **Status:** `LIVE` — open engineering; something still has to be done

A24 band 1 requires the fixed-cell model to return deployer mass per satellite within ±1 % of
`payload_family.py`'s figure, and encodes that figure as the literal **6.375 kg**. That literal
was `payload_family.py`'s output when the band was declared. **P53** corrected the output to
**7.042 kg**, so the band now reads `7.042 against 6.375` and **FAILS by 10.5 %**.

**The model and its reference still agree.** Both return 7.042. What disagrees is the band's
frozen snapshot of the reference.

**The band is not being edited.** It stands as declared and it stands as failed, because the rule
that bands are never adjusted after a result is known does not carry an exception for the times
it is inconvenient — and a band that references a moving quantity by value is a real defect in
the band, not a technicality.

**What would close it.** A **re-declared A24-R band 1** stating the tolerance against
`payload_family.py`'s *current* output rather than a snapshot of it, dated, with the original
band quoted beside it, and committed **before** the re-run. Every other band in A24 is unaffected.

### P55. `velocity_levers.py` prices every lever at the superseded centre-plane K<sub>t</sub>: MEDIUM, NEW 2026-08-14
> **Status:** `LIVE` — open engineering; something still has to be done

`analysis/velocity_levers.py` drives `motor_model.shot()` with a per-row K<sub>t</sub>, and every
row carries a value derived **before** [ADR-030](docs/adr/030-apply-the-depth-resolved-thrust-constant.md): the
as-drawn rows at `11.0258e-3`, the thinner-magnet rows at `9.14e-3` and `8.02e-3`, the two-layer
rows at `7.33e-3`. All four are **centre-plane** figures. The depth-resolved solve measured the
as-drawn array at **0.9558** of its centre-plane value, so every row in the table is optimistic
and `docs/DESIGN_OPTIONS_exit_velocity.md` inherits it.

**Why it is not fixed by scaling.** Applying 0.9558 to the changed-geometry rows assumes the depth
factor is independent of magnet thickness and airgap, and **nothing has measured that**. Scaling
them would produce four numbers that look derived and are assumed.

**What would close it.** Re-derive K<sub>t</sub> for each distinct magnetic geometry in the table
with `thrust_constant(nz=9)`, the same way the as-drawn value was re-derived, and re-run. It is
one solve per distinct geometry, four in total.

### P56. The phase-spacing claim is compared against the wrong baseline: **CORRECTED 2026-08-14 by A21-R**
> **Status:** `LIVE` — open engineering; something still has to be done

> **Corrected.** A21-R ran on 2026-08-14, six of six bands pass, and the claim has been restated
> as orbit change in `README.md`, `SUMMARY.md`, `wiki/Home.md`, `docs/index.html`, `CONCEPT.md`,
> `LANDSCAPE.md`, `MARKET.md`, `CASE_STUDY.md`, `REVIEW_RESPONSES.md`, `FIGURE_INDEX.md` and both
> manuscripts, with release timing named as the free baseline for phase. **No band was edited:**
> A21's seven stand as declared and A21-R's six were declared before `comparators.py` changed,
> which changed by addition only. Measured: **468 s** by waiting against **1.38 days** commanded;
> **+28.8 km** of semi-major axis against **0 m**; **×1.602** of lifetime against **×1.0000**.

**Found by a literature check, 2026-08-14.** The front door, `SUMMARY.md`, `docs/CONCEPT.md`,
`docs/LANDSCAPE.md` and the manuscript all carry a version of:

> 30° of constellation phase spacing in **1.4–6.9 days**, against roughly **25 days** by
> differential drag, and **not achievable by design** with a spring.

**Differential drag is not the baseline a reviewer will use.** Satellites released at different
times from the same host arrive at different true anomalies **in the same orbit**, at zero Δv. At
450 km the in-track rate is **0.0641 °/s**, so:

| | |
|---|---|
| 30° of in-track separation, by waiting | **468 s — 7.8 minutes** |
| 30° by commanded differential velocity | 1.4 days |
| 30° by differential drag | ~25 days |

**And this project's own adopted cadence already does it.** [ADR-020](docs/adr/020-inter-shot-cadence.md)
sets the inter-shot interval at **1200 s**, which is **76.9° of in-track separation per shot** —
two and a half times the spacing the claim celebrates, for free, before the motor does anything.

**A spring and a clock deliver 30° of phase. The claim that a spring cannot is false.**

**What the two things actually do is different, and that difference is the fix.**

| | Timed release | Commanded differential |
|---|---|---|
| Satellites end up in | **the same orbit**, different true anomaly | **different orbits**, different period |
| Phase behaviour | **static — holds forever** | **drifts — never stops** |
| Cost | zero | the whole machine |

For a string-of-pearls constellation, **timed release is not merely cheaper, it is better**: it
gives a spacing that holds. Commanded differential velocity passes *through* 30° at 1.4 days and
keeps going, and a propulsion-less satellite cannot null it. **The design cannot hold a
constellation it phases.**

**What survives, and it is the stronger claim.** No amount of waiting changes an *orbit*. Raised
apogee (450 → 507.6 km), **+60.2 % of orbital life** against a spring's +8.2 %, and placement into
a chosen altitude shell are things only Δv buys. **The differentiator is orbit change, not phase
change**, and the repository has been leading with the weaker of the two.

**What would close it.** Restate the claim wherever it appears — front door, `SUMMARY.md`,
`CONCEPT.md`, `LANDSCAPE.md`, `MARKET.md`, `REVIEW_RESPONSES.md` and the manuscript — as orbit
change rather than phase spacing, with timed release named as the correct free baseline for phase.
`analysis/comparators.py` band 3 asserts *"a spring's designed differential is zero"*, which is
true and no longer sufficient; it needs a companion row for release timing. **The band is not
edited** — it passed as declared. A re-declared A21-R adds the row.

### P57. A voice-coil CubeSat deployer making this project's core claim has been on the reading list unread since 2026-07-30: HIGH, NEW 2026-08-14
> **Status:** `LIVE` — open engineering; something still has to be done

[`RELATED_WORK.md`](docs/RELATED_WORK.md) already flags it: *"the nearest published neighbour to
this design's topology that has turned up so far. It has not been read."* A search on 2026-08-14
establishes what it claims, and it is this project's claim.

**Zhao, Yue, F. Yang & Zhu (2022),** *IEEE Trans. Ind. Electron.* **69**, 13305 — a double
magnetic-circuit voice coil actuator **for CubeSat deployers**, whose stated purpose is *to control
precisely the separation velocity of CubeSats with different masses*, where *the separation speed
of the CubeSat can be directly controlled by regulating the current value*. It is a **direct-drive
linear machine with no moving magnet carrier** — the sled-free topology this project has been
treating as an open design direction — and it is cited by **all three** Harbin papers.

**Why this is a defect and not a reading task.** `docs/PROVENANCE.md` records **P22**: a literature
check found published work on this exact concept that the paper did not cite, and two claims did
not survive it. **This is the same failure, on the paper the project had already identified as the
nearest neighbour and then did not retrieve for two weeks.** Any novelty claim about programmable
separation velocity is unsupported until it is read.

**What would close it.** Retrieve and read it in full; record thrust, stroke, actuator mass,
velocity range, payload range and whether hardware was tested, in `PRIOR_ART.md` under the same
five fields as the other five; then state explicitly what this project claims that it does not.
IEEE Xplore is blocked from this environment, so this needs institutional access.

### P58. The thesis manuscript was a stale fork of the conference manuscript: CORRECTED 2026-08-14
> **Status:** `CORRECTED` — found, fixed and propagated. Retained as the published record

**Found while correcting P56.** [ADR-031](docs/adr/031-four-repositories-not-two-phases.md) states
that paper and thesis carry **"the same concept … different scope … but not different designs."**
They were different designs.

`VOLLEY-thesis/source/paper.tex` and `VOLLEY-paper/paper/paper.tex` share every section heading,
every figure path and 414 of 447 lines. **The 33 that differed were all superseded numbers** —
K<sub>t</sub> 11.03 against 10.54, exit velocity 16.4 against 16.0, 10.5 g against 10.1, 2.85 kJ
against 2.78, 240 mm of regen stator against 39, 76.5 kg against 84.5, efficiency 21.0 % against
18.8 %, deployer mass per 3U satellite **6.38 kg against 7.04**, and the depth-averaging sentence
[ADR-030](docs/adr/030-apply-the-depth-resolved-thrust-constant.md) added, which the thesis lacked
entirely. **Not one difference was thesis-specific.**

**Why it happened.** The manuscript moved into the companions under
[ADR-028](docs/adr/028-no-latex-in-the-flagship.md) on 2026-08-13 and stopped being generated. The
export tool that had kept the two in step no longer touches either, and nothing replaced it — so
the baseline change reached the repository the author edited and not the one they did not. **The
same shape as P53**: a propagation that stopped at the boundary of the tool that performed it.

**Corrected.** The thesis manuscript is now byte-identical to the conference manuscript and rebuilt
at fifteen pages with no undefined references.

**What is not fixed.** Nothing checks this. Two authored manuscripts in two repositories can fork
again the moment either is edited, and neither `check_links.py` nor `make_baseline.py` can see
across a repository boundary. **A cross-repository manuscript check is the missing tool**, and
until it exists this defect is one edit away from recurring.

### P59. Kill criterion 1 is unreachable by architecture and unreachable by manifest size: CRITICAL, NEW 2026-08-14
> **Status:** `LIVE` — open engineering; something still has to be done

**A36 band 4 missed.** The band required kilograms per satellite to reach the ~2 kg threshold at a
manifest of **N ≤ 30**. It first reaches it at **N = 116**.

Two runs have now closed two of the three routes to this criterion by measurement:

| Route | |
|---|---|
| **Architecture** | **Closed by [A35](validation/A35_constraint_ledger.md).** 49.23 kg — 58.2 % of dry mass — survives every deletion of every requirement in all 64 corners. The deletable fraction caps at 41.8 % |
| **Manifest size** | **Closed by [A36](validation/A36_magazine_density.md) band 4.** The N → ∞ limit is a healthy 0.954 kg/satellite, but 2.0 kg is first reached at **N = 116**, and no factorisation of 116 packages inside the 1500 mm track length. The largest manifest that fits is **N = 126**, at **1.941 kg/satellite** on a **244.6 kg** machine running a **42-hour** campaign |
| **Smaller payloads** | **Open.** `docs/PAYLOAD_CLASSES.md` already puts PocketQube at 0.266 kg/satellite |

**The criterion survives by one route, and that route is a different market.** A PocketQube
deployer is not a 3U deployer with smaller cells — it is a different product, a different customer
and a different qualification campaign, and every CAD file, cassette and cost model in this
repository is 3U. That is **D2** in `docs/STATE_OF_THE_PROJECT.md`, which has been open since
2026-08-13 and is now the only thing standing between this project and a crossed kill criterion.

**What this is not.** It is not a reason to widen the criterion. `docs/KILL_CRITERIA.md` sets ~2 kg
because that is the class figure a canisterised dispenser achieves, and a threshold moved after a
result is known is not a threshold. **The correct outcomes are: change the payload class, accept
the criterion as crossed and say so on the front page, or renegotiate it against a stated
capability-normalised metric** — and the third needs care, because *Δv per kilogram per satellite*
flatters this design by 5.4× and is exactly the sort of metric a project adopts when the plain one
has stopped being kind.

**What would close it.** An owner decision on payload class (**D2**), taken explicitly and recorded
as an ADR. No analysis closes this; two have now tried.

> ### A third route opened the same day, 2026-08-14 (**A37 band 5**)
>
> **If the deployer is not carried by a stage but *is* one**, 43.33 kg of this ledger becomes stage
> structure that names the subsystem providing it, and 29.75 kg is deleted outright by a design
> with no mover and no pulse. What remains is **11.45 kg of containment**, and on a small

>

> actually pays.

### P60. The energy store scales as v² and is now the binding constraint: **CORRECTED 2026-08-14 by A39**
> **Status:** `CORRECTED` — found, fixed and propagated. Retained as the published record

> **Corrected.** A39 ran the store trade the entry asked for, seven of seven bands. **The store was
> the wrong store.** A steel spring is 11.41 kg at 32.7 m/s and busts the budget at 34.3; **cold gas
> is 2.98 kg and busts it at 89.4.** The reason is not energy density — **a spring must be cocked
> twelve times and gas does not**, so 4.28 kg of wind mechanism becomes a valve. Corrected for the
> three assumptions most likely to be optimistic, gas lands near 6 kg and every band still passes.
>
> **A35's falsification test passes with it:** the pulse chain released 23.76 kg and its replacement
> weighs 2.98, against a 14.26 kg falsifier. **The mass did not relocate.**
>
> **What replaces it:** gas removes a mass problem and introduces a fluid-system problem. Filling a
> 0.43 litre swept volume in a 133 ms stroke is roughly **3 L/s** through a regulator, and A39
> models none of it. The binding constraint on velocity is now **stroke length**, not mass.

**A37 bands 4 and 8 missed.** Band 4 was the falsification test
[A35](validation/A35_constraint_ledger.md) declared and left open: the pulse chain released
**23.76 kg**, so its replacement had to weigh under **14.26 kg** or the mass had merely relocated.
Band 8 required the store to stay under half of everything added.

At the selected point the store and its mechanism weigh **41.86 kg — 78.5 %** of added mass.

**The physics.** Store energy goes as **v²**, so spring mass does too: 4.91 kg at 1.5 m of stroke,
9.81 kg at 3.0 m, **26.16 kg at 8.0 m**. Stage length is free and the spring that exploits it is
not. **Every previous run in this project was about where the kilograms live. This one says the
next question is a store trade.**

**Two things about this failure are recorded rather than glossed.**

**The selection rule was badly designed.** No declared stage class satisfied every band, so the
script fell back to maximum velocity — the worst case for both failing bands. **At the small class
the falsifier passes comfortably at 7.85 kg.** The bands are evaluated as declared and the failure
stands, but its proximate cause is a fallback rule rather than the physics.

**And the declared classes bracket the answer without containing it.** Derived after the run and
not a band: every declared band is satisfied for stroke between **1.83 m and 2.18 m**, at
**30.0–32.7 m/s** and about **1.83 kg/satellite**. The classes declared were 1.5, 3.0 and 8.0 m.
**No class was added after the run and none will be.**

**What closed it.** [A39](validation/A39_store_trade.md), the store trade this entry asked for,
declared against the window above rather than around it and carrying the gas store A37 deliberately
excluded. Seven of seven bands. **The gas mechanism model is still assumed rather than derived** —
1.5 kg of piston, seals, regulator and valving, the largest guess in that run and over half the
selected total.

**What it does not undo.** A37 band 5 passed at **1.608 kg/satellite**, so kill criterion 1 closes
at 3U on the small class. **P60 is about how fast the machine can be, not whether it closes.**

### P61. A34's recorded figures are stale against its own script: MEDIUM, NEW 2026-08-14
> **Status:** `CORRECTED` — found, fixed and propagated. Retained as the published record

**A38 band 1 missed.** It drove A34's own imported closed forms at the Gen5 point and required
A34's published answer back within 1 %. It returns **27.88 ms** against a recorded **27.25**, a
2.3 % miss.

A34 was recorded on **2026-08-13**, at the operating point
[ADR-030](docs/adr/030-apply-the-depth-resolved-thrust-constant.md) superseded **the same day**.
`analysis/cradle_restitution.py` computes its inputs live from `motor_model`, so **the script
tracked the correction and the record did not.**

| | Recorded | Current |
|---|---:|---:|
| Payload force | 413.2 N | **395.1 N** |
| Offset moment | 28.92 N·m | **27.65 N·m** |
| Angular acceleration | 688 rad/s² | **658 rad/s²** |
| Settling at e = 0.7 | 27.25 ms | **27.88 ms** |
| Preload per contact | 85.0 N | **81.2 N** |

**No band verdict flips.** Re-running A34 today passes all five of its bands. Only the recorded
detail values are stale.

**Corrected.** A34's run sheet is **not edited** — it is a record of a run at its own operating
point, which is why `validation/A*.md` is excluded from every propagation this project runs. It is
**annotated in place** with both columns side by side, the treatment `docs/CROSS_INDUSTRY.md` and
`docs/VALIDATION_REPORT.md` already carry, so a reader reaches the current figures without the
record being rewritten.

**The general case is not fixed.** Every run sheet whose script reads `motor_model` live has the
same exposure, and **nothing checks it.** A regression band comparing a run sheet's recorded
figures against its script's current output would catch the whole class; A38 band 1 caught this one
by being pointed at it deliberately. **Recorded rather than built**, alongside the cross-repository
manuscript check **P58** names and the same tool does not exist for either.

### P62. The published wiki drifted sixteen days and four corrections behind its own source: MEDIUM, NEW 2026-08-14
> **Status:** `CORRECTED` — found, fixed and propagated. Retained as the published record

`wiki/Home.md` is tracked here and is corrected by every propagation this project runs. **The live
wiki is a different git repository** — `VOLLEY.wiki.git` — that nothing here writes to, and
**nothing anywhere said so.**

On 2026-08-14 the live page had not been touched since **2026-07-30**. It still named the project
*emocd*, still quoted a **20.37 m/s** headline from before the CAD sled reconciliation, still
reported a **×1.62** lifetime multiplier from before the depth-resolved thrust constant, and still
made the phase-spacing claim withdrawn the same week as **P56** — **a claim shown to be false, on
the most public surface this project has.**

**Two charts on it were worse than the prose.** The energy split carried the pre-correction values,
and the conjunction chart plotted **20.00–21.00 m/s**, a velocity regime three corrections out of
date. Both are recomputed at the current point, and the conjunction chart gained the caption it
needed: a 2.5 % change in velocity moves the minimum approach from **42.2 km to 9.3**, which is why
this project quotes the realignment period as the robust quantity.

**This is P58 and P61's class.** Every check here walks tracked files; the wiki is tracked, so it
was corrected. **It is published across a repository boundary no check can see.**

**Corrected.** `tools/publish_wiki.sh` publishes the source and `--dry-run` shows the delta first;
`wiki/README.md` states that committing `Home.md` changes nothing a reader sees until it is
published. **The publish itself is not done** — GitHub does not expose wiki content through its
API and this environment's git proxy will not credential a `.wiki` repository, so it needs an
ordinary checkout.

**And the honest disposition of the surface itself.** The wiki is **the least trustworthy thing
this project publishes**, because it is the only one that can be stale without anything failing.
The page says the repository is authoritative; it now also says so where it can be checked.

### P63. A39's gas result assumed a regulator it did not price: **CORRECTED 2026-08-14 by A41**
> **Status:** `CORRECTED` — found, fixed and propagated. Retained as the published record

> **Corrected.** The regulator was removed rather than priced. A41 ran the third repair —
> a chamber charged to a commanded pressure over the indexing window, fired as a closed adiabatic
> expansion. Eight of eight bands. **A 2 L chamber at 50 bar gives 30.54 m/s at 25 g, on a 4.66 kg
> store**, against A39's regulated estimate of 2.98 and A40's fixed-orifice **14.16 m/s**.
> **Added mass per satellite is 1.343 kg** against A37's 1.608, at a higher velocity.
>
> **There is no regulator, no flow-rate problem and no valve timed to a millisecond.** Velocity is
> commanded by charge pressure at **0.499 % per 1 %**, a static measurement taken before the shot,
> against A40's valve timing at **10.53 % per ms**.

**A40 bands 1, 3, 6, 7 and 8 missed.** [A39](validation/A39_store_trade.md) selected cold gas at
**2.98 kg** on a quasi-static argument: swept volume times a **50 bar working pressure** equals the
energy needed. **Holding 50 bar at the piston through a 2.18 m stroke is a regulator**, and A39
neither said so nor sized one.

[A40](validation/A40_blowdown_transient.md) modelled the unregulated version — a fixed orifice fed
from the 200 bar bottle — and it does not work:

| | |
|---|---:|
| Mean acceleration needed for 32.7 m/s over 2.18 m | **25.0 g** |
| Mean acceleration delivered by a fixed orifice | **4.7 g** |
| Exit velocity | **14.16 m/s** against a 30 m/s band |
| Gas consumed | **3.39 g** against A39's 24.02 |

**The cylinder is smallest at the start, so pressure peaks there; as the piston runs away the
volume grows faster than a fixed orifice can fill it.** Flow area is not the constraint — the
orifice is **0.71 mm** against a 10 mm limit. A fixed area cannot track a growing volume.

**What this does and does not overturn.** A39's mass result is **not refuted, it is conditional**:
2.98 kg holds *if* a regulator that maintains 50 bar while flowing ~0.36 kg/s, and settles inside a
133 ms stroke, fits inside the **1.5 kg** allowance A39 declared for "piston, seals, regulator and
valving" — **the largest guess in that run, and now the component the whole result depends on.**

**What survives.** One **1.71 L** bottle does run twelve shots, with **4.5 %** velocity droop
(A40 band 5). That was the result most likely to fail on a transient and it held.

**What closed it.** The third of the three: a **pre-charged chamber**, in
[A41](validation/A41_precharged_chamber.md). The first-order guess that the expansion ratio would
be the binding variable was right — **velocity saturates toward the 2139 J constant-pressure
ceiling while gas grows linearly with chamber volume**, so 2 L to 4 L buys 1.0 m/s and costs
3.2 kg. **The regulator and the profiled orifice are not disproved, only unnecessary.**

**And one band failure was a declaration error, recorded as such.** A40 band 1 assumed a wide
orifice reproduces A39's case. It does not — it reproduces the *unregulated* 200 bar case, which is
**100 g** on this piston. The band stands as failed; what it exposed is this entry.

### P64. A41's reservoir is sized on gas the bottle cannot give back: HIGH, NEW 2026-08-14
> **Status:** `LIVE` — open engineering; something still has to be done

**A42 band 3 missed.** [A41](validation/A41_precharged_chamber.md) sized the reservoir by dividing
total charge by storage pressure — **6 L at 200 bar for twelve 100 bar·L charges.** That assumes
the bottle can be drawn to **zero**. It cannot: below the charge pressure it can no longer fill a
50 bar chamber, and the last quarter of the gas is stranded.

**A42 measures it running out at shot seven of twelve.**

**The correction is bounded, not single-valued, and the reason is A42's own model.** It treats the
reservoir as **adiabatic**, so it cools as it empties and loses pressure faster than mass alone
would give. That is right for a fast blowdown and **wrong for a cadence of twenty minutes**
([ADR-020](docs/adr/020-inter-shot-cadence.md)), where the bottle re-equilibrates between shots.

| | Reservoir | Store | Added per satellite |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **Isothermal**, the cadence case | **7.65 L** | **4.67 kg** | **1.344 kg** |
| **Adiabatic**, as modelled | **11.25 L** | **6.01 kg** | **1.455 kg** |

**Band 3 fails at either end and bands 5 and 6 pass at either end**, so the architecture is not in
doubt — **the store mass is, by about 1.3 kg**, and the truth sits nearer the isothermal figure.

**What would close it.** A thermal model of the reservoir between shots, which is the only term
separating the two columns. Failing that, **carry the adiabatic figure**, which is the conservative
one, and say that it is.

**And the cheap repair if the reservoir ever needs to shrink:** the fired chamber vents **43 bar of
a 2 L volume every shot** and A41 models no recovery of it at all.

### E30. The architecture trades twelve parallel one-shot mechanisms for one twelve-cycle series mechanism, and nothing estimates its reliability: NEW 2026-08-10
> **Status:** `LIVE` — open engineering; something still has to be done


**Raised in review, 2026-08-10, and it is the strongest structural criticism this design has
received.**

A spring dispenser is **twelve independent one-shot mechanisms in parallel**. One failure costs
**one** satellite. VOLLEY is **one mechanism in series with itself, cycled twelve times**: the
sled, stator, bank, sequencer and brake serve every shot, and the escapement and retention gate
cycle twelve times each. A failure at shot *k* forfeits shots *k* through 12.

**That is a real and unfavourable structural change, and no amount of component quality removes
it.** It is arithmetic, not opinion:

| Per-shot p (or per-unit q) | VOLLEY satellites | Spring satellites | VOLLEY fleet-years | Spring fleet-years |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 0.99 | 11.25 | 11.88 | 23.74 | 16.78 |
| 0.95 | **8.73** | 11.40 | 18.44 | 16.10 |
| **0.935** | 7.96 | 11.22 | **16.81** | **15.84** — break-even |
| 0.90 | **6.46** | 10.80 | 13.63 | 15.25 — **spring wins** |
| 0.80 | 3.73 | 9.60 | 7.86 | 13.56 |

**The two crossover numbers are the answer to "what is the risk/reward ratio":**

- To match a 0.99-reliable spring **on satellites delivered**, VOLLEY needs per-shot
  **p = 0.9985**. For a twelve-cycle electromechanical system with no flight heritage, that is
  not a realistic target.
- To match it **on delivered orbital life**, VOLLEY needs only **p = 0.9347** — because each
  satellite it *does* deliver is worth **1.495×** a spring-deployed one (2.111 yr against
  1.412 yr at 450 km).

**The gap between 0.9347 and 0.9985 is the risk/reward ratio, and it is the whole argument.**
VOLLEY can afford to lose satellites and still deliver more total mission value — but only above
about **93.5 % per-shot reliability.** Below it, the spring wins outright.

**And a correction the project should make to itself.** The headline **7.52× lifetime extension**
is a ratio of *gains* (+61.8 % against +8.2 %). On **delivered orbital life** the ratio is
**1.495×**. Both are true; the second is the one that governs a risk-weighted comparison, because
a satellite that is never released delivers nothing. **The 7.5× figure flatters in exactly the
comparison a reviewer will make.**

**What is missing, and it is the finding.** **Nothing in this repository estimates p.** There is
no FMEA, no fault tree, no parts count, and no cycle-life test for the escapement, the gate or
the sled. `grep -ri "failure point"` returns nothing. **The project therefore cannot say which
side of 0.9347 it is on**, which means it cannot presently answer whether it beats a spring at
all.

**What would close it:** a parts count and an FMEA to the level of naming every element whose
failure forfeits the remaining manifest; a stated single-failure-loses-N figure; cycle-life tests
for the three cycling mechanisms; and a per-shot p with the reasoning behind it. Adjacent to
**P28** (brake), and it subsumes the specific jam case raised as review item 22.

**Mitigations that exist but are unquantified:** the winding is segmented, so losing one segment
degrades rather than stops (`paper.tex` §VII, and P29 closed the modelling half). The retention
gates are per-cassette, so one gate failure forfeits six rather than twelve. **Neither has been
credited in a reliability model because no reliability model exists.**

### E31. The two ConOps have different launch-interface compliance positions, and nothing distinguishes them: NEW 2026-08-10
> **Status:** `LIVE` — open engineering; something still has to be done


**Found by the ICD survey, 2026-08-10.** See [`docs/ICD_COMPLIANCE.md`](docs/ICD_COMPLIANCE.md).

The review question was whether a published rideshare interface permits deployment at 16.388 m/s.
**It does** — §3.2.2 of the Rideshare Payload User's Guide, Version 10 (September 2024), caps
separation at 1.0 m/s and then exempts containerised CubeSat deployments explicitly, with no
numeric ceiling. **That question is closed and the premise survives.**

**What the survey found instead is that VOLLEY's two configurations are not equally compliant, and
the repository has always treated them as one product.**

| | Dedicated: VOLLEY as a dispenser on the launch vehicle | Hosted: VOLLEY on a separated stage (ADR-024) |
|---|---|---|
| Deployment class | primary, from the launch vehicle | **secondary deployment** — a deployed object deploying sub-payloads |
| Seven-day hold before first shot | **no** | **yes** |
| Active attitude control required at every release | yes | yes |

**The seven-day hold is the expensive one.** E28 found campaign mission life at a real POEM
altitude is about a month — two GMAT runs at 350 km reentered at **36 and 29 days**. **Seven days
is 20–24 % of the window, spent before the first satellite leaves**, and ADR-024 adopted the
hosted configuration as the product framing without this cost in view.

**And it compounds with E29.** The same document requires that *"all secondary deployments must be
performed while under active attitude control. Deployments in uncontrolled directions or during
Payload tumbling are not allowed."* E29 computes wheel saturation at roughly **shot four of
twelve** for a 50 mm thrust-line-to-CoM offset. **After that point the remaining deployments are
not merely degraded, they are non-compliant** — an engineering problem converted into an approval
problem.

**What would close it:** a compliance matrix per configuration, a campaign timeline for the hosted
case that carries the seven-day hold against E28's reentry window, and the CoM-alignment
requirement E29 already asks for — which is now a compliance requirement rather than an
engineering preference.

**Two further items from the same document, neither in any analysis here:**

1. **A dispenser quasi-static case of 10 g axial and 17 g lateral (RSS).** The structural work in
   A18 and A22 is random-vibration and axial-dominated; **lateral is the larger number** and the
   retention gates are least studied in that axis.
2. **An exit-direction requirement** that deployed payloads leave through the +X face of the
   allowable payload volume. VOLLEY fires along its track axis, which on a radial ESPA port is not
   the launch vehicle's +X. Whether the deployer's own volume is the governing frame is an
   interface-review question and is unanswered.

**The survey is one document deep.** No claim about the market should be made from it, only about
this interface at this revision.

### E32. Nothing inhibits the drive during the ascent pressure transit, and a fault there would break down: NEW 2026-08-10
> **Status:** `LIVE` — open engineering; something still has to be done


**Found answering review item 26, 2026-08-10.** `analysis/paschen_multipaction.py`.

**Ordinary operation is safe, by a margin that does not depend on geometry.** The 96 V bus is
**3.41× below air's 327 V Paschen minimum**, and below a gas's *minimum* no voltage breaks down at
any pressure-distance product. Multipaction is the wrong regime by **2.5 × 10⁴** — the converter
gives f × d = 40 Hz·m against a ~10⁶ Hz·m threshold. **Neither mechanism is credible in normal
use, and review item 26 is answered.**

**The fault case is not safe.** The winding is **19.70 µH at 373.2 A, storing 1.37 J per phase**.
A healthy bridge freewheels through its antiparallel diodes and clamps near the bus; an
**open-circuit fault has no such path**:

| Interrupted in | Induced | vs air's 327 V minimum |
|---:|---:|---|
| 1 µs | **7,351 V** | **exceeds by 22×** |
| 10 µs | **735 V** | **exceeds** |
| 100 µs | 74 V | below |

For a 1 mm gap, air reaches its Paschen minimum at **760 Pa (~5.7 Torr)**, a pressure the vehicle
passes through on **every ascent**.

**The defect is that nothing prevents the coincidence.** There is no requirement anywhere in this
repository that the bank be uncharged or the winding unenergised during ascent. The machine has no
reason to be energised then; the rideshare guide read for E31 calls out **power inhibits** as
separately-verified testing; and **the requirement is simply not written down.**

**What would close it:** a stated inhibit — *the bank shall be uncharged and the winding
unenergised while the vehicle transits the Paschen-critical pressure band* — carried into the
qualification plan as a verified inhibit, plus a clamping requirement on the bridge so that a
fault during *operation* in vacuum has a defined current path. Neither exists.

**What this does not need:** a CFD venting model. The conclusion turns on the bus sitting below a
gas constant, which no depressurisation model changes.

### E33. Magnet tolerance leaves a residual dipole that saturates the host's wheel in days, with the machine idle: NEW 2026-08-10
> **Status:** `LIVE` — open engineering; something still has to be done


**Review item 11, computed 2026-08-10.** `analysis/residual_dipole.py`.

**The reassuring half first: an ideal Halbach array has no net moment.** Summing all 56 blocks
over seven whole wavelengths gives **3.5 × 10⁻¹⁴ A·m²** — numerically zero, as it must be, because
the magnetisations rotate through 360° and cancel.

**Tolerance does not cancel.** With class figures for sintered NdFeB — **±2 % on Br, ±2° on
magnetisation axis**, 4000 Monte-Carlo trials over 56 blocks:

| | Residual dipole |
|---|---:|
| median | **0.77 A·m²** |
| 95th percentile | **1.56 A·m²** |
| 99th percentile | **1.92 A·m²** |

**This is at or above typical small-spacecraft magnetic cleanliness allocations**, which commonly
sit in the 0.1–1 A·m² range.

**What it does to the host, in a 30 µT field at 450 km:**

| Residual | Torque | H per orbit | **Wheel saturated in** |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| median | 2.30 × 10⁻⁵ N·m | 0.129 N·m·s | **7.5 days** |
| 95th | 4.69 × 10⁻⁵ N·m | 0.263 N·m·s | **3.7 days** |
| 99th | 5.76 × 10⁻⁵ N·m | 0.323 N·m·s | **3.0 days** |

**against a 15 N·m·s ESPA-class wheel, and this happens whether or not the machine ever fires.**

**Three independent paths now lead to the same failure**, and this is the one that does not
require a shot:

1. **E29** — the shot's mechanical angular impulse saturates the wheel at about **shot four**;
2. **E33** — the residual dipole saturates it in **3–7.5 days**, idle;
3. **E31** — and once attitude authority is gone, remaining deployments are **not compliant**,
   not merely degraded.

**Against E28's 29–36 day campaign window and E31's seven-day hold, the magnets alone can exhaust
the wheel before the campaign finishes.**

**Worst case, deliberately.** No orbital averaging is credited. A body-fixed dipole in a rotating
geomagnetic field averages partially, so these are an **upper bound** — but the bound is the number
that decides whether the ACS can hold a campaign, and no lower bound has been computed either.

**What would close it, and the fix is cheap.** **Magnet screening and matched-set assembly**: measure
each block's moment and axis on receipt, sort into matched sets, and place them to cancel. That is
a manufacturing procedure, not a design change, and it is the standard answer to exactly this
problem. **B-1 already buys a teslameter and eight blocks**, so the screening method could be
demonstrated on the bench article at no additional hardware cost. A compensating magnet is the
fallback. Neither is specified anywhere.

### E34. The brake dumps 18.5 kN into a structure holding eleven stowed satellites, eleven times: NEW 2026-08-10
> **Status:** `LIVE` — open engineering; something still has to be done


**Review item 12, 2026-08-10.**

**Release is the benign half and A23 already showed why:** separation happens **12.2 ms into
coast, at zero commanded force**, so the payload leaves with no force step. The only shock sources
are gate withdrawal and stiction break, both small.

**Brake engagement is not benign, and the payload is the wrong thing to worry about.** By then it
has gone — but **eleven satellites are still in the cassettes**, and they see the arrest through
the structure:

| Arrest | Force into the track | Stops in | Over |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 50 g | 4.6 kN | 201.7 mm | 28.7 ms |
| 100 g | 9.3 kN | 100.9 mm | 14.3 ms |
| **200 g** — the design cap | **18.5 kN** | 50.4 mm | **7.2 ms** |

The sled enters the brake at **14.07 m/s carrying 935 J**, and `cad/parameters.json` sets
`arrest_g_cap: 200` — the tapered pole entry exists specifically to limit deceleration to it.

**A stowed 3U's qualification case is the 25 g CDS cap and the launch random-vibration
spectrum.** It is **not** a 200 g mechanical shock delivered through its own dispenser, **repeated
eleven times**. Nothing in this repository computes what actually reaches a cassette — there is no
shock response spectrum anywhere; `grep -ri "shock spectrum"` returns nothing.

**What would close it:** a shock response spectrum at the cassette interface for the 200 g arrest,
compared against a stated payload shock qualification level, and — if it does not close — either a
lower arrest cap (the 50 g row costs 202 mm of run-out, which the envelope may not have, P9) or
isolation between the brake reaction and the cassette mounts. **Adjacent to P28**, which already
records that the regen stator and the eddy fin do not both fit the arrest section.

### E35. The payload's field exposure is a design variable nobody varied, and fixing it would make the product claim true: NEW 2026-08-10
> **Status:** `LIVE` — open engineering; something still has to be done


**Review items 16 and 14, computed 2026-08-10.** `analysis/mover_separation.py`.

The payload rides **on** the sled, 20 mm from the Halbach faces, and `docs/PAYLOAD_ENVIRONMENT.md`
concedes two losses because of it: a magnetometer-carrying payload cannot use its magnetometer,
and **soft-magnetic parts leave permanently magnetised** — *"the satellite leaves permanently
altered."*

**Nobody had asked what happens if the payload simply sits further away.**

| Standoff | \|B\| | × magnetometer FS | × Earth |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **20 mm — today** | 44.2 mT | **442×** | 983× |
| 100 mm | 306 µT | 3.1× | 6.8× |
| **251 mm** | 90 µT | **0.90× — usable** | 2.0× |
| **400 mm** | 23.7 µT | 0.24× | **0.53× — below Earth's own field** |

(The 251 mm crossing reproduces `PAYLOAD_ENVIRONMENT`'s own figure, which is the cross-check that
the model is the same one.)

**At 400 mm the satellite sees less than Earth's field, and both conceded losses disappear.**

**Why this is more than an optimisation.** The project's central claim is that the satellite is
never modified. **Item 9 established that it is** — magnetically, invisibly, and without the
customer's knowledge. That makes the current configuration the *worst* of the available options,
because it is the only one where the modification is undisclosed:

| | |
|---|---|
| Today | modified, invisibly, unspecified |
| With separation | **genuinely unmodified** |
| With a declared magnetic-cleanliness spec | modified, **knowingly**, to a written interface |

**Separation is what makes the product claim true**, rather than what makes it faster.

**Perpendicular separation is unaffordable** — the machine is 530 mm wide. **Longitudinal is**, and
it is what a tug-and-carriage architecture gives for free (**PII-15**), which also halves the
acceleration zone and therefore bears on **P9**.

**What would close it:** either a longitudinal-separation layout carried into `cad/parameters.json`
with its field recomputed at the real payload station, or — if separation proves unaffordable — a
**declared magnetic-cleanliness zone in a payload interface document**, which does not exist.
ADR-010 covers mechanical mounting only, and **E29 already asks for that same document for an
unrelated reason.**

### E28. Campaign mission life at a real POEM altitude is about a month, and is not modelled: NEW 2026-08-06
> **Status:** `LIVE` — open engineering; something still has to be done


**Found by A15, and only because two GMAT runs stopped early.** R2 (350 km, 55.2 deg) and R3
(350 km, 9.6 deg) never reached the declared 90 days: their twelve satellites **reentered**, R2
halting at **36 days** with all twelve between 182 and 190 km, R3 at **29 days** between 103 and
115 km. Only the 450 km case ran the full 90.

**Nothing in this project models campaign mission life.** `astro.py` computes a lifetime
*multiplier* (x1.62) for a single boosted satellite against an unboosted one, which is a ratio and
not a duration. The deployment story -- twelve satellites, spread in altitude and plane -- has
always been told without saying how long the fleet exists.

**At 350 km that duration is about one month**, and the plane spread this project is pleased about
develops *faster* there, 365 deg in 29 to 36 days against 367 deg in 90 at 450 km, **because the
same drag that separates the nodes is what pulls the satellites down.** The two are not
independent effects to be traded; they are the same effect.

**Why it matters beyond the analysis.** `docs/MARKET.md`, `SUMMARY.md` and `paper.tex` Sec. VII
all present POEM as the flown precedent, and POEM missions have operated near 350 km. A
twelve-satellite campaign there is a **month-long** product, which is materially different from
what a reader assumes when the analysis is quoted at 90 days.

**What would close it:** a stated campaign mission life per host altitude, computed rather than
assumed, with the customer-facing consequence written where the host is described rather than only
in a run sheet. The GMAT runs already contain the data for 350 and 450 km.

`motor_model.py` resolves the winding in 2-D. End effects of a few percent on Kt remain
uncomputed. This is the declared close-out task for the electromagnetic model. The
magnetostatic package now exists, `analysis/femm/emocd_cross_section.dxf` plus
`analysis/femm/FEMM_RUN_SHEET.md` (analysis A1), which supersedes the older
`docs/FEMM_Run_Sheet.md`; the acceptance band in that older sheet predates the
winding-resolved model and should not be used. **Nothing has been run.** A1 closes the
2-D half; the 3-D end effects still need a 3-D solver (Elmer or GetDP are the free
options). Acceptance band declared in `validation/A1_field_femm.md`.

The field cross-check is analytic-vs-analytic (both magpylib and the wave model assume
ironless geometry, where superposition is exact). That is a genuine check of the wave
model but is NOT independent confirmation from a different physical method. Two analyses
are specified and neither has been executed: **A1** magnetostatic (E1 above) and **A4**
sled-chassis structural, which is what P5 and P8 are waiting on. Both, plus A5, A8, are
written up with pre-declared acceptance bands in `validation/`, and A5's GMAT toolkit is
built (`validation/gmat/`) though not yet run. A8 (pulse-power, E17) is
the cheapest of them and needs no CAD, no mesh, and no licence.

### E3. Masses are parametric and unchecked against vendor data
> **Status:** `LIVE` — open engineering; something still has to be done

CAD now exists (`cad/`, nine documents), so the "no CAD" half of this item is closed,
but the mass problem is not. `mass_properties.py` still uses primitive solids with
shell/fill factors, and no component mass is checked against a vendor datasheet;
estimate spread perhaps ±15 %. Fusion-computed masses are **not** a substitute: they use
solid-copper stator, solid-aluminium CubeSats, and steel standing in for NdFeB, which is
why they are deliberately excluded from `cad/parameters.json`. The sled mass (4.86 kg)
propagates directly into the headline velocity (see P5 and P8) and the enclosure,
radiator, and avionics are still missing from the rollup entirely (P10).

### E4. No hardware at any level
> **Status:** `LIVE` — open engineering; something still has to be done

> **A protocol now exists, 2026-07-29.** `docs/BENCHTOP_TESTS.md` specifies four sub-scale

> **Strengthened 2026-07-30, and the reason is competitive.** The Harbin group

> and ±20 %. The bands do not move, they must also cover model error, which is the thing under
> test, but a failure is now interpretable, because the rig can no longer be blamed for it.

TRL 2-3. Nothing has been built, fired, or measured. The velocity, dispersion, and
tip-off claims are all model outputs.

### E5. Host stage properties unavailable
> **Status:** `LIVE` — open engineering; something still has to be done

Recoil budgets are parametric across 300-900 kg host classes because no candidate
stage publishes its mass and control authority. Cannot be closed from public data.

### E6. Absolute orbital lifetimes are uncertain
> **Status:** `LIVE` — open engineering; something still has to be done

Static exponential atmosphere at mean solar activity. Absolute lifetimes swing
severalfold across the solar cycle. The x1.80 ratio was believed invariant and defensible;
**P16 has since falsified the invariance**: GMAT gives 1.73 / 1.78 / 2.07 across low to high
activity. The point value at mean and high activity survives; the invariance does not. `validation/A5_astro_orekit.md` specifies an independent
re-run under GMAT (toolkit built in `validation/gmat/`, Orekit an equally valid
substitute) (different codebases, independently implemented force models) with the band on the ratio and explicitly not on the absolutes. It now also
carries a second leg: reproduce the **measured** decay of 3-5 non-manoeuvring 3U CubeSats
from CelesTrak / Space-Track TLE histories, band 15 % on time-to-decay. Two models
agreeing is weaker than a model reproducing a flown decay, and the flight data is free.

### E7. Velocity dispersion rests on assumed sensor noise
> **Status:** `LIVE` — open engineering; something still has to be done

The 0.027 m/s (3σ) result is a closed-loop simulation using an assumed 8 mm/s sensor
sigma and assumed tolerance distributions. No sensor has been selected or characterised.
The separation side of this is specified in `validation/A7_separation_chrono.md`, whose
tip-off band is taken from a flown deployer rather than chosen. **Tightened 2026-07-31 from
5 to 2 °/s/axis**: the band cited NRCSD-E, the external Cygnus deployer, whose 5 °/s its own
publisher calls provisional, while the internal NRCSD that has flown hundreds of times specifies
**< 2 °/s/axis**. Two deployers, not a contradiction, and the band had been set at the easier of
them. See **P30**.

### E8. Brake energy is thrown away — CLOSED 2026-08-10, into P28
> **Status:** `CLOSED` — resolved; see the entry for what closed it

~1.0 kJ per shot dissipated in the fin. Whether any of it is worth recovering (and what
that would cost in mass and complexity) has not been examined since the efficiency
correction.

**It has been examined since, twice, and this entry did not notice.** The premise — "has not been
examined since the efficiency correction" — was false by 2026-08-03.

| | |
|---|---:|
| Sled energy at release | 1.27 kJ |
| **Recovered by regeneration** (A11, eight of eight bands) | **291.4 J**, 23.0 % of sled KE |
| **Reaching the fin** | **934.7 J** — the "~1.0 kJ" above, now exact |
| Efficiency this credit is worth | 2.2 points, 20.99 % net |

**A11 answered "is any of it worth recovering": yes, 291.4 J of it, and the machine already
does.** What A11 could not answer is whether *more* of it can be, and that question is not open —
it is **P28**, an owner decision with the geometry already priced: 240 mm of regenerative stator
and a 300 mm fin do not both fit the 339 mm arrest section, and **A18 priced the fin side**, which
needs a 0.4–0.5 T pole field to stay inside both the 200 g cap and the 210 mm envelope. Shortening
the fin is not free and giving up regeneration costs the 291.4 J.

**So the remaining question is a layout decision with a cost attached, not an unexamined
possibility.** E8 closes into P28 rather than sitting beside it duplicating the question. The
934.7 J the fin does absorb is not unaccounted for either: **A18 closed E26**, the fin's campaign
transient, and it passes.

### E9. 6U/12U variants are force-limited, not designed

The payload family table is arithmetic from the same thrust constant. No mechanism,
cassette, or structural design exists for larger classes.

Retention gate pin sizing exists (**two D9 A-286 since 2026-08-10**, quasi-static margin 3.98) and the breech launch-lock
blocks are now modelled in CAD (`cad/parameters.json` `track`: `launch_lock`, x = 30-50

is drawn or described, not analysed.

### E13. Two numbers in source documents were never traced — CLOSED 2026-08-10
> **Status:** `CLOSED` — resolved; see the entry for what closed it

- The "780 deg/s" tumble rate from a third-party document. Falsified as
  implausible (would require a ~7.6 m line-of-action offset on a 1 m vehicle) but its
  origin was never found.
- The "1,000+ G hardening" figure, whose context (ground-launch guns) does not apply
  to this design.

**Closed 2026-08-10, on the ground that neither number is load-bearing anywhere.** Both were
disposed of on their merits when they were logged — one falsified by a physical argument, one
ruled inapplicable by context — and what stayed open was only the provenance question, "where did
it come from".

**That question cannot be answered from here and does not need to be.** A search of the tree finds
**no current claim resting on either figure**: "780" survives only in this entry and in
`docs/INVENTORY.md`, which already records it as *"Tumble-rate plausibility to 780 °/s falsified"*
and points at this entry. "1,000+ G" survives only in this entry. Neither appears in `analysis/`,
in any run sheet, or in `paper/paper.tex`.

**An untraced number that nothing depends on is a resolved item, not an open one.** Tracing the
origin of a figure this project has already falsified and does not use would buy nothing, and
carrying it as live debt overstates the register. The falsifications themselves are retained
above, which is the part with any value in it.

### E14. Patent / disclosure: the disclosure has now happened
> **Status:** `LIVE` — open engineering; something still has to be done

Concept and results are public (LinkedIn, and this repository, which is now a **public**
repo carrying the scripts and therefore the operating point). No provisional application
was filed first, so this is done and cannot be undone. What remains is not a decision but
a consequence to be handled: any patent route now runs on whatever post-disclosure grace
period applies in each jurisdiction, India and the US have one, most of Europe does not
counted from the earliest public disclosure, not from today. **If a filing is still
wanted, establish that earliest date and take advice quickly.** If it is not, close this
item out explicitly so it stops reading as pending.

### E15. Sponsorship not secured

The build is the declared next step and is unfunded.

### E16. Reference hygiene
> **Status:** `LIVE` — open engineering; something still has to be done

Three references in `paper/paper.tex` were flagged verify-before-submission and have
not been fully verified: eddy-damper heritage [15], Yudintsev separation dynamics [17],
and the vibro-impact deployment paper [18]. `docs/RELATED_WORK.md` adds a further list of
comparator sources and tooling, **none of it retrieved and read either**, and it carries
the same rule: fetch before citing. The differential-drag comparator (Foster et al. flown
Planet Labs results) is the one worth chasing first, since the paper's 25-day baseline is
currently a model output rather than a measurement.

**What would close it:** full-text retrieval of `\bibitem{eddy}` and the two Foster papers on a
machine without this egress restriction, and a decision on the flight-heritage claim once the
vendor documentation is actually in hand. `docs/RELATED_WORK.md`'s wider list remains
**unretrieved and is not claimed otherwise**. **This is narrowed, not closed** — from three
unverified references to one substantively unverified claim and a reading list.

### E17. The pulse-power chain: PARTIALLY CLOSED 2026-07-28 by A8, with two findings
> **Status:** `CLOSED` — resolved; see the entry for what closed it

**A8 has been run** (ngspice 42, `validation/spice/emocd_shot.cir`). All five declared bands
were met, exit velocity and pulse duration agree to 0.03 % across two different integrators,
peak current +5.98 %, sag +0.18 points, energy +3.59 %. Two findings came out of it anyway:

1. **Quoted sag is state-of-charge, not terminal voltage.** `motor_model.py` models no ESR
   at all; it reports the capacitor's charge depletion, 4.88 %. With a 12 mohm ESR the
   terminal droops to 86.16 V, a **10.25 % total sag**. The servo-headroom argument behind
   the 0.027 m/s dispersion claim is stated against the smaller number.
2. **The `Q_esr = 160 J` default does not reconcile with 12 mohm.** Integral of I^2 dt over
   the shot is 8008 A^2 s, giving 96 J at 12 mohm. The two agree only at about 20 mohm. This
   item asked for a second number against the 160 J; here it is.

The 12 mohm itself appears only in `docs/EMOCD_Computation_Results_C1-C10.md`, which is
superseded. **Datasheets have since been checked against it and it does not survive**: a bank of
this capacitance built from commercial cells is 116 to 185 mohm, and the shot does not close
above 65. See **P26**. This item is no longer about provenance; the number was not merely
unsourced, it was unattainable.

Original item follows.

### E17 (as originally written). The pulse-power chain has never left the analytic model
The supercapacitor bank, the SiC bridge, and the winding exist only as lumped resistances
and ideal switching inside `motor_model.py` and `sizing.py`. Three numbers depend on that
model and nothing else: the **392 A peak current** (which sets the device rating and the
paper's derating discussion), the **4.9 % bank sag** (which underwrites the servo headroom
behind the 0.027 m/s dispersion claim), and the **672 J copper loss** (which carries the
32 % efficiency figure). No transient overshoot at commutation has been computed, and the
`Q_esr = 160 J` default in `sizing.py`, flagged as unsourced during the P2 review before
being traced to the script's own default, has no second number against it.

Specified as **A8** in `validation/A8_pulse_spice.md` (ngspice or PySpice, both free).
This is the least expensive analysis in the plan: no geometry, no mesh, no licence, and it
attacks three headline-adjacent numbers at once.

### E18. Conjunction covariance is invented: NEW 2026-07-27
> **Status:** `LIVE` — open engineering; something still has to be done

Any probability-of-collision result (A6) inherits whatever covariance it is given, and no
covariance exists for a satellite that has never flown. Space-Track **Conjunction Data
Messages** carry real post-deployment covariances for comparable objects and are the
defensible source; `validation/A6_conjunction_cara.md` now names them as the preferred
input, with an explicitly documented assumption as the fallback. Until that is done, no Pc
figure from this project should be quoted as anything but conditional on its assumption.

### E19. Eddy-current heating inside the magnet blocks is not modelled: NEW 2026-07-29

`sizing.py::magnet_temperature()` models exactly one thermal effect on the magnets:
reversible remanence drift with ambient temperature, `alpha = -0.11 %/K`. NdFeB is a
conductor (roughly 1.4-1.6 uOhm*m, some 80-90x copper's resistivity but far from an
insulator), and the blocks sweep past the winding at up to 20 m/s through the field's
spatial harmonics, the belt winding's own 6th-harmonic ripple, slot-like content, and
whatever switching harmonics the SiC bridge puts on the current. That drives eddy currents
in the magnet bulk.

This is not the same failure mode as reversible drift. Local heating risks crossing the
knee point and causing **irreversible** demagnetisation, which no amount of cooling
recovers, and it is worst where the field harmonics are strongest rather than where the
bulk temperature sensor would sit.

No number is offered here because nothing in the repo computes one, and inventing an
order of magnitude for a loss that depends on harmonic content the model does not resolve
would be worse than recording the gap. What can be said without computation: this term
grows with current density, so it works directly against the "raise sheet current to
213 kA/m" option in `docs/DESIGN_OPTIONS_exit_velocity.md`, which that document already
calls thermally hard for the winding alone.

### E20. The brake's force-time profile does not exist: NEW 2026-07-29

anywhere simulates the arrest: there is no force against velocity, no force against
position, no peak, and no duration. `legacy/c3_c4_em.py` sizes the brake by energy, not by
transient.

A first-order estimate from the sled's own kinetic energy across the 210 mm arrest zone
puts the **average** force near 6 kN over roughly 8-20 ms, some 4x the 1413 N
acceleration force, over a tenth of the duration, and with a peak that nothing bounds. The
host therefore sees two oppositely-signed impulses of very different shape per shot, not
one smooth push, and a 12-shot campaign is 24 load reversals through the ESPA bolted
interface.

E5 covers the *magnitude* of the recoil budget across host mass classes. Nothing covers its
*shape*, and A4 is a static analysis that cannot. This is a fatigue and control-bandwidth
question, and it is the natural companion to A7.

### E21. No vacuum tribology anywhere: SUBSTANTIALLY RETIRED BY CITATION 2026-07-29

Searching the entire repository for lubrication, tribology, cold welding or galling returns
nothing. The sled runs on four rollers (30 mm dia x 16 mm) carrying roughly 763 N per pair
at arrest (`sizing.py::arrest_loads()`), reused across twelve shots, in vacuum. Repeated
metal-on-metal rolling and sliding contact in vacuum with marginal or no lubrication is a
well-known deployable-mechanism failure class, and the reusable sled is the one part of
this architecture that a single-shot spring deployer does not have to solve.

Distinct from the neighbouring items: E10 covers the launch-restraint escapement, E11
covers outgassing and contamination. Neither covers the roller-to-rail interface, and no
lubricant, coating, or material pair is specified for it in `cad/parameters.json`.

The eddy brake works because a moving Halbach field drags on a nearby stationary conductor.
That is also the geometry of the entire 1.3 m acceleration zone wherever aluminium or
titanium structure (longerons, guide rails, enclosure skins) sits within reach of the
field. `verify_field.py` puts the stray field at 22.7 mT at 10 mm behind the array and
4.3 mT at 20 mm, which is not negligible at plausible standoffs.

`motor_model.thrust_constant()` computes Kt purely as the Lorentz force against winding
current. It carries no term for eddy coupling into any other conductor. So the model
accounts for eddy drag exactly where it is wanted (the brake) and nowhere it might be
unwanted, and the sign is unfavourable: any such drag subtracts from delivered thrust and
adds heat to the track.

Not quantified here, it depends on the track-to-array standoff and the conductivity of
whatever is actually there, and the standoff is not a single number in `cad/parameters.json`.
The check is cheap once that geometry is pinned, and it belongs with A1.

`sizing.py::track_first_mode()` reports 48 Hz pinned-pinned and 109 Hz fixed-fixed, and
checks them against a single static target: above 70 Hz to clear the launch primary band.
That is the right check for the launch environment and the wrong one for the shot.

The electrical excitation is not at a fixed frequency. It sweeps from zero upward as
`f = n*v/lambda` with lambda = 48 mm, so every shot chirps through the whole band below the
running frequency. At the as-drawn 9.445 kg sled (a = 105 m/s^2):

| Crossing | Speed | Time from start | Distance into the 1300 mm stroke |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6th harmonic through the 48 Hz pinned mode | 0.38 m/s | 3.7 ms | 0.7 mm |
| 6th harmonic through the 109 Hz fixed mode | 0.87 m/s | 8.3 ms | 3.6 mm |
| fundamental through 109 Hz | 5.23 m/s | 49.8 ms | 130 mm |

So both modes are crossed inside the first 4-50 ms of a 158.6 ms stroke, twelve times per
campaign, and the crossings happen in the first few millimetres of travel where the sled is
still adjacent to the breech and the launch-lock hardware.

**The likely answer is that this is benign, and the point is that nobody has shown it.** The
sweep rate is roughly `a/lambda` ~ 2.2 kHz/s, so transit through any plausible half-power
bandwidth takes on the order of a millisecond, which is far too fast for resonant buildup.
But that argument depends on the structure's Q, and **no Q, damping ratio, or loss factor
appears anywhere in the repository**. A static frequency check against a launch target does
not settle a swept-excitation question; the analysis that would is a chirp or Campbell-style
dwell-time check, and it does not exist.

Cheap to close, and it belongs with A4's dynamic leg rather than with A1.

### E24. Attitude disturbance from magazine indexing is not modelled: NEW 2026-07-30
> **Status:** `LIVE` — open engineering; something still has to be done

Found by reading a competitor's problem statement rather than by examining this design, which is
worth stating plainly: Xu et al. (*Aerospace* 11(5) 394, 2024) build a **cost model for attitude
disturbance caused by moving CubeSats around inside the deployer**, and optimise their transfer
paths against it, because a shifting centre of mass degrades platform pointing and therefore release
accuracy.

**This project models the recoil of the shot and nothing about the indexing between shots.**
`analysis/sizing.py` gives 66.1 N·s per ejection and the host nulls it with cold gas. But twelve
satellites feed from two transverse cassettes, so between every pair of shots a mass of order a few
kilograms translates across the structure, and:

- the centre of mass moves, so the host's attitude reference sees a disturbance torque that is
  **not** the shot recoil and is not in any budget here;
- the sled returns to the breech, a second mass motion, also unmodelled;
- the dispersion claim (0.027 m/s 3σ) assumes the track is where the model says it is at trigger
  time. If indexing leaves residual attitude rate or structural motion that has not damped out, the
  release direction carries an error the velocity servo cannot see, because it measures position
  along the track and not the track's own orientation.

**Why it is probably small, and why that is not an answer.** The indexed mass is a few kg against a
124.9 kg loaded system on a host of hundreds to thousands of kg, and the campaign has time between
shots, nothing here suggests a feasibility problem. But P16 was also "probably fine" until an
independent propagator was pointed at it. The quantity that matters is **residual attitude rate at
trigger, and the settling time to reach it**, and neither number exists anywhere in this repository.

**What would close it:** a rigid-body momentum budget for one index cycle, then the settling time
against the campaign's inter-shot interval. Cheap (it is bookkeeping, not a new solver) and it
belongs with the recoil analysis in `sizing.py` rather than with the motor model. Explicitly *not*
claimed to be negligible until that is done.

### E25. A13 now leaves attitude restoration and structural settling open: CORRECTED 2026-08-03
> **Status:** `LIVE` — open engineering; something still has to be done


The corrected rigid-body budget does not leave a residual angular rate after an internal mass
starts and stops. It leaves a transient rate and an attitude offset. At the assumed 166 mm
lever arm, the 500 kg example reaches about 0.136 deg/s during sled return and finishes about
0.42 deg from its initial attitude. The 200 kg example reaches about 0.443 deg/s and 1.37 deg.

The declared transient-rate rows remain FAIL. The ideal residual-rate row passes, but that does
not establish structural settling. No controller, thruster geometry, wheel/RCS authority,
flexible-body mode, damping ratio, or firing schedule closes the attitude offset before the next
trigger. The previous 8.2 s rate-null and 18.1 s cadence floor are superseded. P31's 10--20 s
versus 1200 s cadence contradiction remains unresolved.

### E26. Brake-fin transient temperature across a campaign is not modelled: NEW 2026-08-03
> **Status:** `CLOSED` — resolved; see the entry for what closed it


> **CLOSED 2026-08-06 by A18, and ADR-020 is what closed it.** All sixteen swept

The thermal calculation previously used a 300 x 80 x 4 mm copper fin. The Gen3 STEP and the
validation mass table specify 120 x 80 x 4 mm, 0.344 kg. Correcting that input raises the
adiabatic increment from about 3 K to about 7 K per shot and the twelve-shot no-cooling bound
to about 85 K.

The former statement that each transient decays before the next 10--20 s shot had no transient
conduction or radiation model behind it and is removed. A thermal network, contact conductance,
surface properties, and the resolved P31 cadence are required. The 0.32 m2 radiator number remains
an assumed 130 W steady rejection case, not a demonstrated campaign transient.

### E27. Gen4 finite-stator force and energy are not modelled: **CLOSED 2026-08-05 by A16**

> [`validation/A16_gen4_finite_stator.md`](validation/A16_gen4_finite_stator.md).

The Gen4 working assembly exposes an end effect that the Phase I periodic/uniform-stator model
does not contain. The array is fully overlapped for 751.5 mm of the 900 mm acceleration stroke,
then progressively leaves the stator over the final 148.5 mm. At release, the remaining overlap
is 191.5 mm of a 340 mm array.

An overlap fraction alone is not an accepted force law. End fields, phase progression, winding
termination, current control and force ripple all matter in the edge region. The Phase I
regenerative section is also absent from the declared Gen4 operational selection, so its 291.4 J
credit cannot be carried into a Gen4 efficiency result.

**What would close it:** a position-dependent electromagnetic calculation using the recorded
Gen4 body bounds and stations, with the implementation, tool version, input hash, numerical
settings, tolerances and output hash retained. Compare it with the existing periodic result only
over the fully overlapped interval. Then integrate the force/current trajectory and rerun every
dependent result before exporting or publishing Gen4 performance.
