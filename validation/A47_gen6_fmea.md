## Why this run exists

[E30](../OPEN_PROBLEMS.md) is the strongest structural criticism this design has received, and
it has been LIVE since 2026-08-10:

> A spring dispenser is twelve independent one-shot mechanisms in parallel. One failure costs
> one satellite. VOLLEY is one mechanism in series with itself, cycled twelve times.

`docs/FMEA.md` answered that for Gen5, nine of thirteen elements forfeit the remaining
manifest, against a spring's zero, and r >= 0.99326 per element per cycle is needed to match a
spring on delivered orbital life.

It contains no mention of Gen6. The architecture changed on 2026-08-14 and the failure
analysis did not follow it. So the honest answer to *"is Gen6 more reliable?"* has been nobody
has run it, and the question has been asked.

## Method

The same model, not a new one. `analysis/fmea.py`'s `campaign()` and `required_element_r()`
are imported, so Gen5 and Gen6 are scored by identical arithmetic and the only thing that changes
is the element list. A second model would make the comparison meaningless.

The element list is derived by walking Gen5's thirteen and asking what ADR-032 does to each,
then adding what Gen6 introduces. Every entry names its fate.

Optimistic by construction, and stated: no common-cause failures, elements independent, no
wear-out, and reliability is treated as identical across elements, the same assumptions
`fmea.py` already makes, kept so the two are comparable rather than because they are right.

## Acceptance bands

Declared before the script. Not to be edited after the run.

| # | Band | FAIL if |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | Re-running the imported model on **Gen5's** element list reproduces **r ≥ 0.99326** to within 0.0001 | The import is not the model `docs/FMEA.md` used, and nothing below is comparable |
| **2** | Every Gen5 element is accounted for in Gen6 as **deleted, retained, or replaced** — none silently dropped | The comparison is an assertion rather than a derivation |
| **3** | Gen6 has **fewer** manifest-forfeiting shared elements than Gen5's nine | Deleting the mover, stator, bank, converter and brake does not simplify the failure structure, and the architecture's main claim needs restating |
| **4** | Gen6's required per-element reliability is **lower** than Gen5's 0.99326 | Gen6 is *harder* to make reliable than the machine it replaced |
| **5** | Expected satellites delivered at a **common** r = 0.99 is **higher** for Gen6 than Gen5 | Same |
| **6** | **Neither** architecture reaches a spring's zero manifest-forfeiting elements | A result that flattering means the model has stopped counting shared elements correctly |
| **7** | The **gas store is counted as manifest-forfeiting** — one reservoir feeds twelve shots | The single most obvious shared element in the new architecture has been missed |
| **8** | A **per-cell backup ejector** is evaluated, and its effect on expected delivery at r = 0.99 is reported | The cheap parallel fix E30 points at is not priced, and the run answers only half the question |

## Predictions, recorded before the run

1. **Band 3 passes** — six of Gen5's nine shared elements are deleted outright, and Gen6 adds
   roughly four or five, so the count falls but by less than the deletion suggests.
2. **Bands 4 and 5 pass, and by a narrower margin than the architecture change implies**, because
   the elements Gen6 keeps, sequencer, cradle, magazine, gate, launch lock, were never the
   drive's, and they are what the campaign multiplies twelve times.
3. **Band 8 shows the backup ejector doing more than the architecture change did.** Converting
   the drive from manifest-forfeiting to satellite-forfeiting is a change of *structure*; deleting
   subsystems only changes the *count*.
4. If 3 is right, the honest conclusion is that Gen6 improves reliability incidentally and E30
   is not answered by it.

## Result

**RUN 2026-08-16. Eight of eight bands pass — and the run answers the question it was asked in a
way that does not favour the architecture change.

| | Elements | Manifest-forfeiting | Required *r* | Delivered at *r* = 0.99 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **Gen5, as published** | 13 | **9** | **0.99326** | **6.620** |
| **Gen6** | 12 | **8** | **0.99252** | **6.992** |
| **Gen6 + per-cell ejector** | 8 | **3** | **0.98388** | **9.261** |
| *a spring dispenser* | 12 | **0** | — | **11.880** |

| # | Band | Result | |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | reproduces Gen5's published 0.99326 within 0.0001 | **0.99326** | **PASS** |
| 2 | every Gen5 element accounted for | 0 unaccounted | **PASS** |
| 3 | Gen6 has fewer shared elements | 8 against 9 | **PASS** |
| 4 | Gen6's required *r* is lower | 0.99252 against 0.99326 | **PASS** |
| 5 | expected delivery at *r* = 0.99 is higher | 6.992 against 6.620 | **PASS** |
| 6 | neither reaches a spring's zero | Gen5 9, Gen6 8 | **PASS** |
| 7 | the gas store counts as manifest-forfeiting | yes | **PASS** |
| 8 | the backup ejector is evaluated | 9.261 against 6.992 | **PASS** |

### Deleting six subsystems removed one shared failure

ADR-032 deletes six of Gen5's nine manifest-forfeiting elements, sled, stator, converter,
brake, sled return, and commutation. The count goes from nine to eight.

It adds five: the gas reservoir, the fill valve, the fire valve, the piston and seals, and the
chamber. And one Gen5 never had at all,

> Host stage keep-alive. The machine now depends on a vehicle somebody else owns staying
> alive past passivation. No launch provider has agreed to it, and it forfeits the manifest
> exactly as a bank failure did.

The failure modes changed discipline, from windings and switches to seals and valves. The
structure barely moved.

### The result that matters, and it is not the architecture

| Change | Satellites delivered at *r* = 0.99 | Gain |
|---|---:|---:|
| Gen5 → Gen6, an entire architecture | 6.620 → **6.992** | **+0.37** |
| Gen6 → Gen6 with a per-cell ejector | 6.992 → **9.261** | **+2.27** |

A spring in every cell is worth six times the architecture change. Deleting subsystems changes
the *count* of shared elements; putting a mechanism in each cell changes the *structure*, the
drive stops being manifest-forfeiting and becomes satellite-forfeiting, which is the only move
that touches what E30 actually says.

It does not deliver the Δv. A 1-2 m/s ejector guarantees clearance, not the orbit change the
product is sold on. What it converts is *"the drive died and we lost eight satellites"* into
*"the drive died and eight satellites deployed with no benefit"*.

And it does not reach a spring's 11.880 either, because the sequencer, launch lock and
magazine remain shared. Zero manifest-forfeiting elements is not available to any architecture
that shares a magazine.

### The predictions

All four held, and the third by a wider margin than expected.

1. Band 3 passes, count falls by less than the deletion suggests — **nine to eight, on six
   deletions.
2. Bands 4 and 5 pass narrowly — **0.99326 → 0.99252**, and 6.620 → 6.992.
3. The backup ejector does more than the architecture change, six times more.
4. So the honest conclusion is the predicted one: Gen6 improves reliability incidentally, and
   E30 is not answered by it. Recorded as P75.

## What this run does not do

- No common-cause failures. A reservoir leak and a valve failure share a gas circuit; a
  sequencer fault can command a valve wrongly. Independence is assumed and is the weakest
  assumption here.
- One reliability across all elements, which is `fmea.py`'s assumption, kept for
  comparability. A COTS valve and a bespoke cradle do not have the same *r*.
- No wear-out, on components cycled twelve times, including a piston seal whose friction has
  never been measured (P67).
- The ejector is not designed. Mass, volume, and its own failure rate are unpriced, and it
  competes for the cell space the magazine already uses.
