# A29: what air costs a ground test of exit velocity

Bears on: [`../docs/BENCHTOP_TESTS.md`](../docs/BENCHTOP_TESTS.md),
[`../docs/QUALIFICATION_PLAN.md`](../docs/QUALIFICATION_PLAN.md), and E4, because the
full-scale ground test is the step that turns this project's headline velocity into a measurement.

The machine flies in vacuum. The test happens in a room.

Every velocity in this repository is computed with no aerodynamic drag, because there is none in
orbit. The TRL-5 step in `QUALIFICATION_PLAN.md` is a full 1.5 m track firing a mass simulator
into the eddy brake in a laboratory at sea level, and its whole purpose is to compare a
measured exit velocity against the computed one.

Nothing in this repository says what the air is worth. A measured velocity compared to
16.388 m/s without an air correction is biased low by an amount nobody has computed, and the
comparison is therefore not a validation of the motor model, it is a validation of the motor
model plus an unquantified error.

## Result, 2026-08-13: the correction is 5.1 mm/s, and two bands fail

`validation/cfd/`, result in `analysis/results/cfd_air_drag.json`, figures
[`cfd/figures/A29_cfd_report.png`](cfd/figures/A29_cfd_report.png) and
`paper/figures/F14_airdrag.png`.

| Band | Test | Result | |
|---|---|---:|---|
| 1 | fine and coarse mesh agree within 10 % | **4.86 %** | **PASS** |
| 2 | 0.7 ≤ C_d ≤ 2.5 | **0.523** | **FAIL** |
| 3 | deficit below 1.0 % of v_exit | **0.0312 %** | **PASS** |
| 4 | deficit ≥ 10 % of the 0.0267 m/s dispersion | **19.2 % of it** | **PASS** |
| 5 | channel C_d exceeds free-stream C_d by ≥ 10 % | **−12.7 %** | **FAIL** |

### The answer the test needs

| | |
|---|---:|
| Drag at exit velocity, free stream | **1.734 N**, spread ±0.144 N over the averaging window |
| Work against air over the 1.30 m stroke | **1.127 J** |
| Exit velocity, vacuum → sea-level air | **16.3880 → 16.3829 m/s** |
| **Deficit** | **5.116 mm/s (0.0312 %)** |
| Against the 3σ dispersion the test exists to resolve | **19.2 % of it** |
| As a servo command instead | **1.734 N, 0.125 % of the 1389 N shot** |

A full-scale ground test can be run in air and does not need a vacuum chamber. But
every velocity it measures must carry the correction, because 5.1 mm/s is a fifth of the
dispersion the test is there to resolve. A measurement compared to 16.388 m/s without it is
being compared to the wrong number by an amount comparable to the quantity being measured.

**Bands 3 and 4 together are the useful result**, and they point in opposite directions on
purpose: band 3 says the term is small, band 4 says it is not small *enough to ignore*. Either
alone would have been misleading.

**One thing the bands do not ask, stated because a reader will.** The bands measure the
open-loop deficit, which is what a raw shot comparison sees. A servo tracking the velocity
profile nulls it instead, and it appears as 1.734 N of extra commanded force, 0.125 % of the
shot, rather than as velocity error. So a *closed-loop* ground test measures the right
velocity and hides the air in the current trace; an *open-loop* one measures 5.1 mm/s slow. Which
of those a test is depends on how it is run, and the run sheet in
[`../docs/QUALIFICATION_PLAN.md`](../docs/QUALIFICATION_PLAN.md) does not currently say.

### Band 1 — the coarse mesh is converged, and it settles band 2

| Mesh | Cells | C_d |
|---|---:|---:|
| Coarse, refinement level 4 | 92,774 | **0.5230** |
| Fine, refinement level 5 | **581,779** | **0.5497** |
| | | **4.86 % apart** |

6.3x the cells moves the answer by under 5 %, so the coarse result is not mesh-limited. The
fine mesh reports a *slightly higher* drag, and it is still **well below band 2's floor of 0.7**.
**That settles what band 2's failure means**: refining the mesh does not recover the missing
drag, so the low coefficient is a property of the geometry and the reference area, not of the
discretisation. Everything in the next section rests on this band having passed first.

### Band 2 fails, and the solve is not what is wrong

C_d = 0.523 against a declared floor of 0.7, 0.419 of pressure drag solved plus 0.104 of
viscous bound.

**The band was declared against a solid bluff body and the assembly is not one.** A rectangular
body normal to the flow sits near 1.05-1.2, and that is where 0.7 came from. What the CFD is
actually resolving is a stepped body: the 3U payload leads with a 100 x 100 mm face, and the
sled behind it is wider, 172 x 140 mm, so a large part of the reference frontal area sits in
the payload's own wake. Referencing a coefficient to an area that is partly shadowed gives a
coefficient below the textbook value for the shape it was compared against.

**Band 1 above is the first of four checks that the solve is right and the band was the wrong
shape of question:

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Peak C_p anywhere on the body | **0.975** — a stagnation point should approach 1.000, and it does |
| Meshed wetted area vs raw STL surface | **0.4173 m² of 0.5612 m²** — the difference is the payload–sled interface, interior and correctly not wetted |
| Where the drag comes from | Forward faces **+0.233**, base suction **+0.156**, sides **+0.001** — the classic bluff-body split, and the sides contributing nothing is the signature of a fully separated flow rather than a meshing artefact |

**The band is left exactly as declared and is not re-run.** Recorded here so the next sheet does
not repeat it: **a drag band must name the reference area and the shape it is being compared
against, because a drag coefficient without its reference area is not a number. Logged as
P48.

### Band 5 fails in the opposite direction to the one predicted, and that is a finding

The band predicted the stator plates would **raise** C_d by at least 10 % through confinement.
They lower it by 12.7 %, 0.457 in the channel against 0.523 in free stream, with a
tighter spread (±3.5 % against ±8.3 %).

The plate is acting as a splitter, not as a wall. It sits in the mid-plane the sled straddles,
and a splitter plate in the near wake is a textbook way of *suppressing* wake oscillation and
raising base pressure, which is exactly what the reduced spread says is happening.

The consequence is the useful part: the free-stream figure is the conservative one. A ground
test corrected with the free-stream C_d over-corrects by 13 %, i.e. by 0.6 mm/s, which is
comfortably inside the dispersion. The correction should be quoted from the free case, and
that is a conclusion the band's failure produced rather than obstructed.

### What the solver does not do, reported rather than smoothed

The solve does not converge, and it is not supposed to. Velocity residuals fall three orders
in the first 300 iterations and then plateau near 5 x 10⁻² and oscillate, which is what a
steady solver does on a massively separated bluff-body wake, the flow it is being asked to hold
still is not steady. Pressure and turbulence residuals sit near 2 x 10⁻³.

So the drag is a windowed mean, not a reading. Five written iterations spanning 160 SIMPLE
steps: 1.734 N ± 0.144 N, an 8.3 % peak-to-mean spread. A single iteration would have
reported 1.601 N or 1.889 N with equal confidence, and the first attempt at this sheet did read
one iteration, 1.946 N, 12 % high. The spread is quoted with every mean in this sheet for that
reason.

Viscous drag is bounded, not solved. `wallShearStress` aborts in this OpenFOAM build with the
same IOstream error as `forceCoeffs`. Rather than rebuild a wall shear stress from cell-centre
gradients, a second, weaker solve dressed as a first, the viscous term is Schlichting's
turbulent flat-plate correlation over the meshed wetted area, C_f = 0.074 Re_L^(−1/5) =
0.00501, giving 0.344 N. It is 17.7 % of the total and is labelled a bound everywhere it
appears. The pressure term, which dominates, is solved.

And the drag force is integrated here, not read from a function object. `forceCoeffs` aborts
too, so `validation/cfd/forces.py` integrates F = ρ Σ p S_f over the body patch directly from
`constant/polyMesh` and the solved field. That is a stronger position than the function object,
not a weaker one: every step between the solve and the coefficient is inspectable. The first
attempt returned a negative drag, the sign convention inverted, because OpenFOAM's boundary
normals point out of the *fluid* and therefore into the body. `forces.py` now asserts drag is
positive, since a bluff body in a uniform stream does not produce thrust.

## What is being computed

Steady incompressible RANS (`simpleFoam`, OpenFOAM v1912, k-ω SST) around the Gen5 sled and its
3U payload as generated, meshed with `snappyHexMesh` from `cad/stl/VOLLEY_Sled_Gen5.stl` and
`cad/stl/VOLLEY_Payload_3U_Gen5.stl`. No idealised box. The geometry is the same file the CAD
package ships, so the drag figure cannot describe a different machine from the one being built,
the same rule `validation/fem3d/` follows for the field.

The moving assembly spans 644 mm along the track, 172 mm across it and 140 mm in
depth. Free-stream velocity is the exit velocity, 16.388 m/s, in air at 1.225 kg/m³ and
1.5 x 10⁻⁵ m²/s, giving a Reynolds number of order 10⁵ on the frontal dimension, turbulent,
bluff, separated, and not a regime where a textbook drag coefficient can be trusted to better
than a factor.

Drag is then integrated over the 1.30 m acceleration zone. Because the profile is
position-scheduled, v² rises linearly with distance and the drag force with it, so the work done
against air is not a constant times the stroke.

## Acceptance bands

**Bands 3, 4 and 5 can fail, and each failure means something different. None of them is edited
after the run.

### Band 1 — the solve is converged in the mesh, not in the physics

The drag coefficient computed on the fine mesh agrees with the coarse mesh to within 10 %.

If it does not, the number is a property of the mesh and nothing below it means anything.
**FAIL above 10 %.**

### Band 2 — the answer is physically possible

Drag coefficient referenced to the assembly's projected frontal area lies in
0.7 <= C_d <= 2.5.

A rectangular bluff body normal to the flow sits near 1.05-1.2 in free stream and higher under
blockage. **Outside this range the solve is wrong, not the machine** — this band exists for the
same reason the 3-D field solve's did, because a converged run that returns a physically
impossible number reports success.

### Band 3 — a ground test can be corrected rather than evacuated

The exit-velocity deficit from air over the 1.30 m stroke is below 1.0 % of 16.388 m/s, i.e.
below 0.164 m/s.

**This band may fail.** Above 1 %, air is not a correction applied to a measurement — it is a term
comparable to the design margins, and the ground test would have to be run in a vacuum chamber
that no laboratory-budget plan in this repository contains.

### Band 4 — and the correction is not negligible against what the test measures

The deficit is at least 10 % of the published closed-loop dispersion, 0.0267 m/s (3σ), i.e.
at least 0.00267 m/s.

**This band may fail, and failing is good news:** below 10 % the air correction is lost inside the
dispersion the test is trying to resolve and can be ignored. Above it, every ground-test
velocity measurement must carry an air correction or it cannot be compared to the model at all.
The band is written this way round deliberately — it tests the claim that the correction matters,
not the claim that it is small.

### Band 5 — the stator channel is not just background

C_d computed with the sled confined between the stator plates exceeds the free-stream C_d by at
least 10 %.

The sled runs inside a 12 mm winding gap between two stator plates, so the flow around it is
confined rather than free. **This band may fail**, and failing means the channel is open enough
that a free-stream coefficient suffices, which is worth knowing, because it is what a reader
would assume without checking.

## What this cannot settle

- Steady RANS on a body that is accelerating. The assembly reaches 16.388 m/s over 158.6 ms;
  the solve treats each speed as steady. The quasi-steady assumption is standard for this
  Reynolds number and this acceleration, and it is an assumption, not a result.
- No moving mesh, no track, no ground effect. The body is held still in a moving stream. The
  track structure and the room are absent.
- One atmosphere, one temperature. Sea level at 20 °C. A test at altitude sees less.
- Nothing here is measured. E4 stands. This computes a correction to a measurement that
  has not been taken, which is the honest description of what it is for.
- It says nothing about flight. In orbit this term is exactly zero. A29 exists only because
  the *test* happens in air, and a result that could not be compared to the model would be a
  wasted test rather than a wrong machine.
