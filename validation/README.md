# Validation plan

Independent cross-checks of the claims in `analysis/`. **Nineteen of the twenty-one below have run.**
**Two of them failed**, two are partial, one returned three rows that could not be evaluated at
all, and one found a published number 37 % high.

## Why it exists

This directory was written when `PROVENANCE.md` could point at only two cross-checks — the
Halbach field (analytic vs magpylib) and orbital decay (orbit-averaged vs Cowell RK4) — both
internal, and the field one analytic-against-analytic, so not confirmation by a different
physical method (`OPEN_PROBLEMS.md` E2).

**That has changed, and not uniformly in the project's favour.** A1 put a meshed PDE solve
against K<sub>t</sub> and agreed to 0.03 % after correcting shared quadrature. A4 put CalculiX against the chassis and it passed.
A12 put two independent numerical methods against the array attraction and found the published
value **37 % high**. And **A5 failed**: an independent propagator falsified an invariance claim
that was in the paper's own abstract.

**What has still never happened is a measurement.** Every row below is one model against
another model (E4). Each analysis closes a specific named item.

| # | Analysis | Tool | Closes | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Airgap field, 2-D magnetostatic | scikit-fem + gmsh (FEMM substituted) | E1 (2-D half), E2 (partly) | **RUN 2026-07-29**, verdict **PARTIAL**: K<sub>t</sub> agrees to 0.03 % after correcting shared quadrature, two bands missed with causes (P20, P21) |
| A4 | Sled chassis structural | CalculiX ccx 2.21 | **P5, P8** | **RUN 2026-07-28**: as-drawn plate passes all three bands |
| A5 | Orbital lifetime and seeding | GMAT R2022a | E6, hardens x1.80 | **RUN**, verdict **FAIL** on invariance. See [`../docs/RESULTS.md`](../docs/RESULTS.md) |
| A9 | Decay rate against flown CubeSats (TLE history) | Space-Track + numpy | **E6, against reality rather than another model** | **NOT RUN**, blocked by network policy here and re-tested 2026-07-31. **Candidate objects now shortlisted** in the sheet, so this is an afternoon elsewhere |
| A6 | Conjunction probability | scipy 2-D Pc (CARA substituted) | P1 — **not closed** | **CORRECTED 2026-08-03**: fixed-shape claim retracted; current slab bound 4.4e-5, two of five bands, three **VOID**, P1 open |
| A7 | Separation and tip-off | Project Chrono | E7-adjacent | **still specified, not run.** **A7-R RUN 2026-08-05** instead: Chrono is unavailable and the release mechanism is undefined, so the tolerance was computed rather than the rate — the full push may act unbalanced for only **50.7 µs** before the 2 °/s band breaks |
| A8 | Pulse-power chain | ngspice / PySpice | E17 | **RERUN 2026-08-05** as A8-R2 at the corrected point: six of six bands, exit velocity agrees to 0.016 % |
| A10 | Shot against a realistic bank ESR | `motor_model.shot()` | nothing; **opened P26** | **RERUN 2026-08-03**: hard ceiling 68 mohm, five of six bands, one VOID |
| A11 | Regenerative recovery of sled energy | `motor_model.regen_brake()` | nothing; asks what R5 did not | **RERUN 2026-08-03**: 291.4 J recovered, eight of eight bands |
| A12 | Inter-array attraction, two numerical methods | magpylib + surface Maxwell stress | **P17** | **CORRECTED 2026-08-03**: extended stress plane 2680.0 N vs 2686.6 N volume force; five of five bands |
| A13 | Indexing and sled-return attitude disturbance | momentum bookkeeping | **E24** | **CORRECTED 2026-08-03**: transient-rate rows 3/4 FAIL, row 7 VOID; ideal residual rate is zero and the cadence conclusion is superseded |
| A14 | EMI scoping: payload coupling and comms | `drive_electrical` + magpylib | advances **E12**; **opened P34** | **RUN 2026-08-05**, verdict **PARTIAL**: six of eight bands, band 4 **FAIL** at 611x, band 5 VOID. The dominant term is the static magnet field, not the drive |
| A16 | Gen4 finite-stator thrust vs sled station | magpylib | **E27** | **RUN 2026-08-05**: full-overlap thrust reproduces `F_cmd` to 0.000 %; Gen4 reaches **13.390 m/s, 81.7 % of Phase I**, an upper bound |
| A17 | Ripple chirp through the track modes | scipy SDOF | **E23**; **opened P36** | **RUN 2026-08-05**, verdict **FAIL**: 8.18x amplification at the fundamental crossing of the 109 Hz mode, and Q is not the variable that saves it |
| A18 | Brake, magnet eddy, fin transient, launch restraint, standoff | numpy + Miles | **E20, E19, E26, E22**, and E10's analysis half; **opened P37** | **RUN 2026-08-06**: E19/E26/E22 pass, E20 passes only for a 0.4-0.5 T pole field, **E10 FAILS at every Q** |
| A20 | Reachable orbit envelope vs host Δv budget | numpy + `astro.py` | nothing; quantifies **ADR-024**, advances PII-6 | **RUN 2026-08-10**, verdict **band 1 FAIL**: the band named a two-burn Hohmann and its limit was computed for one burn. Band 3 caught a sign bug in the script. Host supplies 56 % of the altitude extent at 100 m/s |
| A21 | VOLLEY against springs, drag and cold gas, identical axes | numpy + `astro.py` | nothing; **replaces the headline ratio** | **RUN 2026-08-10**: seven of seven. **7.52×** the lifetime extension of the fastest spring against 6.56× on velocity; mass parity at 1.062; cold gas wins at 3U by 7.5×, declared as a loss in advance. **RE-RUN 2026-08-14** at the corrected operating point (**P53**): still seven of seven, at **7.33×**, **6.41×**, parity 1.062 and **8.3×** |
| A22 | Retention gate resize against the random-vibration case | numpy + `phase1_closeout.e10` | **P37**, E10's analysis half | **RUN 2026-08-10**: six of six. 2 × D6 → **2 × D9** takes the margin at Q = 30 from **−0.36 to +0.45** and keeps it positive across Q = 10–30, for **11 g** |
| A23 | Tip-off at release, modelled rather than bounded | numpy rigid body | advances **E7**; **opened P41** | **RUN 2026-08-10**: release is comfortable — it happens 12.2 ms into coast at zero force. **The payload arrives in its cradle at 36–231 °/s**, 18–115× the band, and nothing had modelled it |
| A24 | The payload ladder as a fixed-cell design, not a volume ratio | numpy + `payload_family.py` | ADR-025; **opened P44** | **RUN 2026-08-10**: five of six, **band 6 FAIL**. **1U no longer closes kill criterion 1** (36/load, 2.125 kg, not 40/1.913); **ThinSat and 12U do not fit at all** — the 166 mm cassette width is a constraint written nowhere else. Band 6 missed at 0.508 % against 0.5 %: 720 ChipSats need **7.19 kg of shim hardware for 3.6 kg of payload** |
| A25 | A flywheel energy store against P26 | numpy + `motor_model.py` | targets **P26**; **opened P45** | **RUN 2026-08-10**: five of six, **band 4 FAIL** by 1.1 kg. **Band 6 — the point of the exercise — passes decisively: 35 mΩ against A10's 68 mΩ ceiling, 66 kW deliverable against 32.5 required.** Needs no architecture change. Mass parity, not saving; the miss turns on one unsourced machine specific-mass figure |
| **A2** | The 3-D field, and the depth assumption inside K<sub>t</sub> | numpy + magpylib | closes **E1**'s 3-D half; **opened P46** | **RUN 2026-08-10**: four of four run, **band 4 (getdp FEM) NOT RUN so E2 stays open**. The field was never 2-D — the *thrust integral* was. Resolving depth costs **4.42 % of K<sub>t</sub>** (10.5386 → 10.5386), **v_exit 16.029 → 16.029**. **Baseline not changed**; computed and held. Band 1 caught a 57 % normalisation bug in the analysis; **band 3 was badly chosen** and measures numerical cancellation at 10⁻²⁰ T |
| A27 | Why a linear motor, and not a screw, rack or spring | numpy + `motor_model.py` | answers review item 18 | **RUN 2026-08-10**: screw **disqualified by kinematics** (49,164 rpm; DN 8.2× over, critical speed 37× under); rack fails on **vacuum contact at 16.0 m/s**; **a ~1.8 kg spring works at 21.1 g** and fails only on commandability. **The motor is chosen for commandability, not performance** |
| A35 | Every kilogram attributed to the requirement that causes it | `mass_properties.py`, no new physics | nothing; **quantifies whether kill criterion 1 is reachable at all** | **RUN 2026-08-14**: seven of seven. **Energy arriving during the shot is the largest single driver at 28.1 %**; an unmodified satellite costs **nothing**, which calibrates against the sibling repository's negative result. **The lattice saturates at 41.8 %: 49.23 kg survives every deletion in every combination — 4.10 kg per satellite — so no architecture change closes kill criterion 1.** The prediction of >40 % for the pulse alone was wrong |
| A36 | Magazine density, the only lever A35 left on kill criterion 1 | numpy-free, `constraint_ledger.py` | **opened P59** | **RUN 2026-08-14**: six of seven, **band 4 FAIL**. The N → ∞ limit is a healthy **0.954 kg/satellite**, but 2.0 kg is first reached at **N = 116**, which no factorisation packages inside the track length. Largest that fits is **N = 126** at **1.941 kg/sat** on a **244.6 kg** machine, 42-hour campaign. **At N = 24 it is 4.330 kg, not the 2.05 estimated from A35 by naive division** |
| A37 | The stage as the deployer, and A35's falsification test | numpy-free, `constraint_ledger.py` | **advances P59; opened P60** | **RUN 2026-08-14**: six of eight, **bands 4 and 8 FAIL**. Of 126.56 kg, **29.75 is deleted by Gen6 physics, 43.33 is stage structure and 11.45 kg is added** — all of it containment. **Added mass per satellite is 1.608 kg on a small kick-stage class, so kill criterion 1 closes at 3U**, with dry mass per satellite still crossing at 7.044 and both reported together. The store scales as v² and reaches **78.5 %** of added mass at 8 m, so **the binding constraint moves from mass to energy storage** |
| A38 | Does A34's cradle closure survive the Gen6 operating point? | numpy-free, imports `cradle_restitution.py` | **advances kill criterion 4; opened P61** | **RUN 2026-08-14**: five of six, **band 1 FAIL**. At 2.4× the offset moment the closure **improves** — settling **17.69 ms of 133.3** against 27.88 of 150.1, critical restitution **0.9462**, residual still exactly zero. **Tip-off's ceiling is 30.9 g, above the 25 g cap, so it does not bind and A37's window stands.** Cost is preload, **81 → 202 N** per contact. Band 1 caught A34's recorded figures being stale by 2.3 % against its own script |
| A39 | The energy store at metre-scale strokes | numpy-free | **closed P60**; settles A35's falsifier | **RUN 2026-08-14**: seven of seven. At 32.7 m/s a steel spring is **11.41 kg** and busts the budget at 34.3 m/s; **cold gas is 2.98 kg and busts it at 89.4**, on a **1.71 L bottle for all twelve shots**. Not energy density — **a spring must be cocked twelve times and gas does not.** **A35's falsifier passes: 2.98 kg against 14.26.** The binding constraint on velocity moves from mass to **stroke length** |
| A40 | The blowdown transient, and how velocity is commanded | numpy-free | **opened P63**; amends ADR-032 | **RUN 2026-08-14**: three of eight, **bands 1, 3, 6, 7, 8 FAIL**. **A fixed orifice cannot hold force over a 2.18 m stroke** — 4.7 g mean delivered against 25 needed, **14.16 m/s against a 30 m/s band**. Flow area was never the problem (0.71 mm against a 10 mm limit); a fixed area cannot track a growing volume. **A39's 2.98 kg assumed a regulator it never named.** What survives: **one 1.71 L bottle does run twelve shots at 4.5 % droop.** Band 1 was a declaration error and is recorded as one |
| A41 | The pre-charged chamber: charge slowly, fire as a closed expansion | numpy-free | **closed P63**; specifies Gen6's store | **RUN 2026-08-14**: eight of eight. A **2 L chamber at 50 bar** gives **30.54 m/s at 25 g on a 4.66 kg store** — no regulator, no flow-rate problem. **Added mass per satellite 1.343 kg** against A37's 1.608, at a higher velocity. Velocity commanded by charge pressure at **0.499 % per 1 %** against valve timing at 10.53 % per ms. **All three stated predictions were wrong**, on a run where every band passed |
| A42 | The fill window, and the gas a bottle cannot give back | numpy-free | **opened P64**; answers ADR-032's falsifier | **RUN 2026-08-14**: five of six, **band 3 FAIL**. Filling is **4.14 s through a 1 mm orifice** and is not the constraint. **A41's 6 L bottle runs out at shot seven of twelve** — below the charge pressure it cannot fill a 50 bar chamber. Correction is bounded: **7.65 L isothermal, 11.25 L adiabatic**, added mass per satellite **1.344–1.455 kg**. First prediction this session that held |

| A43 | Does the reservoir warm back up between shots? | numpy-free | **opened P66**; sizes Gen6's reservoir | **RUN 2026-08-16**: seven of eight. Conduction through stagnant nitrogen gives a **17 460 s** time constant against a **1200 s** cadence, so **the bottle does not warm back up** and the no-relaxation figure is the physically right end, not merely the conservative one. **9.55 L**; conduction estimate 8.95 L, isothermal limit 8.25 L. A42's 7.65 and 11.25 L are superseded |
| A44 | What Gen6's open-loop shot actually disperses to | numpy-free | **drives ADR-033** | **RUN 2026-08-16**: six of eight. **3σ of 1.113 %** against Gen5's 0.0274 m/s, and **93.4 % of the variance is seal friction (P67)**. A fivefold better pressure transducer moves it **0.008 %** — **there is no instrumentation route to the product's central claim** |
| A45 / A45-R | What the stage credit is actually worth | numpy-free | **opened P68**; fires ADR-032's first falsifier | **RUN 2026-08-16**: five of eight. Break-even at **8.4 %** of the credit, and **58.6 % of it is a skin on a vehicle nobody has agreed to lend.** Added mass per satellite reads **1.403 to 3.271 kg** depending on how hostilely the credit is read, and **both ends are published everywhere** |
| A46 | The enclosure, built up from the geometry instead of assumed | numpy-free | **replaced P10's placeholder** | **RUN 2026-08-16**: five of eight. **50.04 kg where an 8.00 kg placeholder stood** — skins 32.82, frames 8.20, radiator 2.59, bay boxes 1.87, fasteners 4.55. Five derived lines, each tracing to a dimension in `parameters.json`. **42 kg, not the 20 the warning guessed at** |
| A47 | Gen6's FMEA, against Gen5's and against a spring | numpy-free | quantifies **E30** | **RUN 2026-08-16**: eight of eight. The architecture change buys **+0.37 satellites** at *r* = 0.99; **a per-cell backup ejector buys +2.27** — six times more, because it makes the drive satellite-forfeiting rather than manifest-forfeiting. **Eight shared elements must survive every shot** |
| A48 | The trim stage: how much correction, at what mass | numpy-free | **adopted as ADR-033**; **opened P77** | **RUN 2026-08-16**: seven of eight. **37.7 J — 2.021 % of the shot — over 39.7 mm, for 0.340 kg.** The precision Gen6 traded is recoverable. Band 5 was a declaration error, recorded as **P76**. **The pulse store that feeds it is not weighed** |
| A49 | The velocity, acceleration and stroke surface | numpy-free | **adopted as ADR-034**; **opened P78** | **RUN 2026-08-16**: seven of nine. **14 points of 63 beat Gen6 on velocity, peak g and gas at once** — every one of them at **L = 8.0 m**. Band 3 confirmed **peak acceleration is independent of stroke**, so stroke is an exchange rate rather than a performance knob. **Band 6 failed: friction's share rises 9.75 % → 12.90 % across the sweep and 28.39 % at the chosen point** |
| A50 | The campaign, with altitude as the free variable | numpy-free | **opened P79**; **E28** stays open | **RUN 2026-08-16**: seven of nine. Satellite life **476.6 days at 450 km**; three 50 km shells cost **≈ 55 m/s**. **The 90-day plane spread moves 47.1° → 44.6° across 350–450 km while life changes 6.7×**, so E28's central trade is not one — **go higher**. Band 1 failed: the static atmosphere gives **70.6 d at 350 km** against E28's observed 29–36 |
| A51 | Power and efficiency, end to end at Gen6 | numpy-free | **opened P80** | **RUN 2026-08-16**: seven of eight. **311.76 J/shot, ≈0.26 W average, 36 W peak.** Band 7 traced the repeatedly quoted **"25–131 W"** to `host_integrated.py`'s spring-winding figure — **Gen6 has no spring and its reservoir is ground-filled**. Corrected in seven files |
| A52 | Recoil and angular impulse at Gen6 | numpy-free | **answers E29** | **RUN 2026-08-16**: seven of seven. **116.03 N·s per shot — 1.81× Gen5**, 1407.9 N·s over the campaign, **0.653 kg** of propellant to null. The interface requirement follows: **the thrust line must pass within 10.7 mm of the host centre of mass**, against Gen5's 19.5 mm |
| A53 | The per-cell backup ejector, designed rather than priced | numpy-free | **opened P81** | **RUN 2026-08-16**: seven of eight. **Band 7 fails by 40.4×**: the ejector stores 4.5 J and clearing the 2.18 m sealed tube costs 181.8 J. Sized to clear, **8.713 kg — 2.129 kg per satellite, over the threshold**. **The failure is architectural, not conceptual**; ADR-034's 8.0 m stroke makes it 148× |
> **Two entries above are document reviews rather than banded runs**, and are filed in `docs/`

| A19 | Sensitivity ranking of nine assumed inputs | numpy + the real pipeline | nothing; **ranks** the assumptions behind P29, P28, `STRUCTURAL_GAP` | **RUN 2026-08-10**, verdict **band 1 FAIL**: net efficiency has two different leaders depending on the metric, so both rankings are published. `v_exit` does not respond to bank ESR at all — nil, then total |

A10 and A11 are cross-checks of the model against its own physics rather than against an
external tool, which is a weaker class of check and is labelled as one. They are here because each
asks a question no external solver was going to be pointed at: whether the bank can source the
shot at all, and whether the sled's energy has to be thrown away. **A12 is stronger than both** —
its two methods share only the block model of the magnets — and **A6 is weaker than any of them**,
since both its geometry and its covariance come from inside this project.

> **This table was wrong about A1 for a day**, from 2026-07-30 to 2026-07-31: it said "specified,
> not run" while `OPEN_PROBLEMS.md` E1 and `docs/ROADMAP.md` both recorded A1 as run on
> 2026-07-29. The cause is worth keeping, because it is the reason A1 and A5 now carry their

> A11 already used.

A2 (3-D field, end effects) and A3 are not specified here; A1 closes only the 2-D half of
E1, and the 3-D end effects still need a 3-D solver.

## The one rule that makes these tests rather than exercises

**The acceptance band is declared before the analysis runs.** Every run sheet in this
directory states its band up front, and each band is traceable to a current value in
`analysis/results/*.json`. A cross-check whose target is chosen after seeing the answer
proves nothing.

This is not hypothetical here. `docs/FEMM_Run_Sheet.md` was written against ⟨B⟩ ≈ 0.62 T
across the winding gap; the winding-resolved model now computes **0.552 T**, so that
sheet can no longer function as a test and is marked superseded. The replacement sheet
(`analysis/femm/FEMM_RUN_SHEET.md`) had the same problem in its stray-field targets,
they predated the P3 correction, and was fixed on 2026-07-27.

When a band is missed, the outcome is a new P-item, not a quietly widened band.

**A field band must name which field, at which plane, as which quantity.** Added 2026-08-10 from
**P20**, and it is aimed at **A2** in particular. A1's array-surface band was declared against
`analytic_B0_surface_T` = 0.7714 T, the fundamental amplitude of a **single** array's ideal wave
at its own surface. Any measurement at that plane in a **double-sided** machine includes the
opposing array, worth `B0·exp(-k·GAP)` = 0.160 T there, so the correct double-sided reference is
**0.9317 T** — and the FEM's fundamental is 0.9312 T, a ratio of 0.9994. **The row failed as
declared and the model was right.** A raw peak at that plane reads 1.4641 T and is a third
quantity again, mesh-dependent, because the plane sits on the magnet face where block-corner
harmonics dominate and the field is formally singular at the corners.

So a band at a magnet surface needs **two references named, not one**: single-sided or
double-sided, and fundamental or raw peak. A1's sheet is left exactly as written — a band is
never edited after its run — and this is where the correction lives instead, so the next sheet
meets it without having to know to search the register for it.

**And when a band cites an external document, record which document, which revision, and whether
a tighter comparator exists in the same family.** Added 2026-07-31 after **P30**: A7's tip-off
band was set at 5 °/s from the external NRCSD-E, whose publisher calls that figure provisional,
while the internal NRCSD that has actually flown specifies 2 °/s. Nobody picked the easy number
on purpose — it is what happens when a band cites one source and nobody asks what else that source
set contains. **A band may still be tightened before a run**, which is how that one was fixed; it
may never be touched after one.

## Conventions

- Inputs come from what is already committed: `cad/step/gen3/*.step` (Gen3 is current,
  see `cad/README.md`), `cad/parameters.json`,
  `analysis/femm/emocd_cross_section.dxf`. Where a check needs an orbit or a constant, it
  imports from `analysis/*.py` rather than restating the value, see `gmat/build_scripts.py`.
- Outputs land in `validation/results/<analysis>.json` alongside the solver version,
  mesh size, and boundary conditions, the same way `analysis/results/*.json` works.
- A completed run gets a `CHANGELOG.md` entry with cause, before/after, and the P/E item
  it moves.
- `analysis/*.py` stays authoritative until a run closes the relevant item. **Do not
  hand-edit a script to match an FEA result**, record the discrepancy first, decide
  second.
