"""A66: what the aluminium drive tube costs the trim stator.

ADR-033 puts the trim stator outside the tube and its magnets inside. ADR-035 then made the
tube aluminium. The tube never moves, so the stator's travelling field crosses it at FULL
SLIP on every shot, whatever the carriage is doing. That is a shorted turn by construction
and this file is the first in the repository to price it.

Two independent methods, because one is not a result.

    thin sheet   the wall lumped into a surface current. Closed form, valid while the wall is
                 thin against the skin depth, and the limit the textbook sheet-rotor result
                 gives for a linear machine.
    exact slab   the field resolved THROUGH the wall thickness by matching A and dA/dy at both
                 interfaces, with the diffusion equation solved inside the metal. Makes no thin
                 wall assumption and reduces to the sheet result when the wall is thin.

They share no expression. The slab route solves a two-interface boundary-value problem; the
sheet route solves a one-unknown self-consistency. Agreement between them is band 6.

The LOSS has only one route, and this file does not pretend otherwise. Its check is the Maxwell
stress bound, which is a separate statement about what a field can do rather than the same
algebra collected differently.

Units are SI throughout.
