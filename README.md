# VOLLEY: thesis companion

Final-year thesis submission material, generated from the VOLLEY flagship.

**[Read the manuscript](source/VOLLEY_IEEE_Conference.pdf)**

## Layout

| | |
|---|---|
| `source/` | Manuscript and figures |
| `analysis/` | The scripts producing every number in the work |
| `validation/` | The analyses, each with its acceptance bands declared before the run |
| `cad/` | The CAD generations, with the defect audit for each |
| `appendix/` | Baseline, defect ledger, validation report, provenance, prior art, literature, decision records |

## For an examiner, in reading order

1. `appendix/PROVENANCE.md`, which says what stands behind each claim and what does not.
2. `appendix/BASELINE.md`, the frozen values, and the rule for changing any of them.
3. `appendix/adr/`, the decision records. Each states the alternatives considered and the
   consequences accepted. ADR-003 carries its own amendment showing an argument it got wrong.
4. `appendix/OPEN_PROBLEMS.md`, every known defect, including the ones that damage the work's own
   claims — and the ones found by checking this work against itself rather than by anyone asking.
5. `appendix/PRIOR_ART.md`, the nearest published work, and the two claims retracted after reading
   it.

The decision records are the part most worth reading. They are where the reasoning lives, and
several of them record the alternative that was rejected and why.

## What is authored here

`source/` holds the manuscript, which is written in this repository — the main record is an
engineering record and carries no manuscript source. `university/` holds submission forms,
formatting mandates and viva material, which are university-specific and do not belong upstream.
**Neither is ever touched by the export. Everything else is regenerated and will be overwritten.**

This repository may be improved until the thesis is presented, and freezes at that moment. What
enters it has to be stable, effective and reliable against the problem statement.

## Before citing

Every number here is a model output. Nothing has been built or measured. The defect ledger is
published deliberately rather than tidied away, and it is the honest measure of how far the work
has actually got.
