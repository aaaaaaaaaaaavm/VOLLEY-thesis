- `EMOCD-main/OPEN_PROBLEMS.md`, full defect and open-problem list
- `EMOCD-main/PROVENANCE.md`, what stands behind each claim
- `EMOCD-main/cad/parameters.json`, single source of truth for all dimensions

Governing rule: `cad/parameters.json` is the single source of truth for
all dimensions. Fusion 360 is authoritative for geometry and fit only.
`analysis/*.py` is authoritative for mass and performance until FEA closes
the open items. No number in the scripts or the paper is changed on the
strength of CAD geometry alone. Nothing is ever deleted from this file,
superseded content is marked SUPERSEDED in place.

## 2026-08-10: GEN4 RENDER SET PUBLISHED, GEN4 STILL NOT EXPORTED

Seven Gen4 shots replace the Gen3 render set on every public surface. The Gen3 firing-sequence
frames were withdrawn under P43: two of them showed the payload departing *through* the ESPA
mounting flange and drew the CubeSat as a wheeled road vehicle from a sample-asset library.

| Published | Superseded |
|---|---|
| `hero_open.png` | `interior_open.png` |
| `espa_interface.png` | `exterior_aft_mounting.png` |
| `envelope_closed.png` | `exterior_closed.png` |
| `sled_detail.png` | `seq2_midstroke.png` |
| `brake.png` | `seq4_braking.png` |
| `track_stator.png`, `magazine_feed.png` | new shots |
|, | `seq1_stowed.png`, `seq3_release.png` withdrawn without replacement |

`exploded_view.png` is the only Gen3 render retained, because Gen4 has no equivalent, and it is
labelled Gen3 wherever it appears.

This does not open the Gen4 export gate and does not create a Gen4 performance claim. The
gate stated above stands: the 340 mm array leaves the finite stator at s = 1051.5 mm and the
position-dependent electromagnetic calculation is not done. The renders are published *ahead of*
the export, which is a deliberate trade recorded in P43, a reader misled about the deployment
direction is worse off than one told the picture is ahead of the model. Every caption on every
surface has been stripped of performance figures for this reason, and each states that no number
is taken from Gen4.

Uncropped frames are committed to `renders/source/`; `tools/prepare_renders.py` generates the
published set from them and is the only thing that should.

## 2026-08-03: PROVISIONAL GEN4 OPEN ASSEMBLY, NOT EXPORTED

`EMOCD_Gen4_Open v7` exists in Fusion 360 as a working open-mechanism configuration. It is
not present in the committed STEP, STL or render set. The repository's Gen3 exports remain the
Phase I CAD record.

The active configuration uses the 488 mm sled at s = 300 mm stowed and s = 1200 mm release.
The brake fin enters the x = 1530-1740 mm brake envelope at s = 1222 mm and clears it at
s = 1552 mm. The 340 mm Halbach array reaches the finite stator edge at s = 1051.5 mm, so the
final 148.5 mm of acceleration is under partial overlap. This prevents a Gen4 performance
claim until the position-dependent electromagnetic calculation is complete.

The primary assembly stays open for explanatory views. The enclosure is retained separately
for envelope checks. `Gen4_Operational_Export` excludes the audit sled, linked source sled,
duplicate brake, construction diagnostic, enclosure check and released-payload reference.
No export has been made from that selection. Full state and gate: `docs/GEN4_STATUS.md` and
ADR-019.

## PART I: SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND DESIGN RATIONALE

This section records *why* each major architectural decision was made,
reconstructed from `EMOCD-main/docs/DECISION_LOG.md`, the analysis scripts,
and the IEEE conference paper. Without this context a dimension is just a
number; with it, a dimension is a consequence.

---

### R1. Why this machine exists: the gap it fills

The project began on 22 March 2021. CubeSats flown as rideshare secondaries
inherit the primary customer's orbit. The spring that ejects them adds 1-2
m/s, enough to drift clear of the host vehicle, not enough to change the
orbit. A satellite with no onboard propulsion is stranded in whatever orbit
the primary customer bought, for life.

The regime between spring deployers (~2 m/s) and propulsive orbital transfer
vehicles (hundreds of m/s) is unoccupied. VOLLEY fills it: a system that can
deliver 3U CubeSats at 10-35 m/s without modifying the satellite at all.

The no-modification constraint is not optional, it is what makes the machine
commercially viable. Any system requiring a ferromagnetic or conducting
armature on the customer satellite forces the customer to redesign hardware,
re-qualify, and accept liability for armature interference with their payload.
No rideshare operator accepts those terms for a secondary slot. VOLLEY routes
around this completely: the magnets ride the sled, the sled stays on the
deployer, and the satellite receives a standard push at the pocket wall,
exactly as a spring deployer gives it.

---

### R2. Why a linear synchronous motor, not a coilgun

The first concept (ARDE/INSARM 2021) was built around a coilgun. The switch
to a linear synchronous motor in mid-2025 is the pivotal decision in the
project's history.

Exit velocity is bounded by v = √(2aL). The payload's structural
qualification caps acceleration: for a 3U CubeSat qualified to NASA GEVS, the
peak quasi-static deployment ceiling is roughly 25-30 g. Over any stroke that
fits a secondary-payload envelope, that ceiling produces a maximum exit
velocity of 26-35 m/s, regardless of what the launcher is. A coilgun capable
of 1 km/s is worthless because the satellite cannot survive 1 km/s.

With that ceiling in place, the coilgun's only advantage is unreachable while
every one of its costs is present:

- 1-2% electrical-to-kinetic efficiency: fundamental, not a maturity
  problem (Sandia-lineage literature across decades of coilgun development).
- Microsecond pulse timing against the suck-back effect at the coil
  midpoint. The firing decision is irrevocable once the pulse starts.
- A ferromagnetic or conducting armature bolted to the customer's
  satellite, the commercial dealbreaker from R1.
- No abort capability after firing starts: the three-inhibit safety
  chain is only meaningful if the shot can be called off.

A linear synchronous motor gives up nothing in the reachable envelope and
inverts every cost:

- 32% electrical-to-payload efficiency at the rated operating point
  (analysis A27, corrected from an earlier 40% figure that double-counted
  sled kinetic energy as regeneration; this was a project error, documented
  in PROVENANCE.md error 3 and OPEN_PROBLEMS.md).
- Continuous proportional thrust with a servo loop that can close on
  position/velocity. Mid-stroke abort is available up to ~45% of stroke
  (~13.5 m/s), the true commit point, corrected from the original claim of
  "anytime before release" (A26).
- The reusable sled carries the magnets. The satellite is never modified.
- Velocity is programmable by the servo loop, enabling the 0.027 m/s
  (3σ) closed-loop dispersion (A29).

Verified outcome: factor-of-16 efficiency advantage over the coilgun it
replaced, at the same exit velocity.

### R3. Why an ironless stator

The first linear-motor layout used an iron-core double-sided stator. Computed
mass: ~65 kg laminations + 32 kg copper, nearly the entire mass budget for
a secondary-payload system.

Beyond mass: an iron-core design creates a sustained ~3.7 kN attraction force
between the Halbach arrays on the sled and the iron stator at all times, not
just during a shot. The sled rollers and guide rails would have to be
designed against this as a permanent preload, feeding back into sled mass,
rail mass, and track stiffness.

Going ironless eliminates both problems. The stator becomes a few kilograms
of copper belt winding. The inter-array attraction still exists (it is what
the sled gap shim tolerance of ±0.05 mm controls, per `parameters.json`
`sled.gap_shim_tolerance`) but acts on the sled chassis, not a fixed iron
core, and only appears when the sled is on the track.

Secondary benefit: the ironless geometry makes the field problem linear and
analytic superposition exact. This is what made the independent magpylib
cross-check a genuine verification rather than two models sharing the same
assumption. The agreement to three digits (0.351 T single-array) is a real
corroboration of the wave model and is one of only two results in the project
with independent corroboration (`EMOCD-main/PROVENANCE.md`).

---

### R4. Why a Halbach array on the sled, not conventional magnets

A Halbach array concentrates the magnetic field on one side and cancels it
on the other. For a double-sided arrangement driving an ironless winding:

First: the airgap field is stronger for a given magnet volume than an
alternating-pole arrangement, raising thrust constant Kt directly. The
winding-resolved model gives Kt = 11.22 N per kA/m (A28).

Second: the near-zero field on the back side of each array substantially
reduces stray field on the enclosure, magazine cassettes, and customer
satellite sitting in the cassette. This is what allows the silicon-steel
septum in the magazine cassette to be 1 mm rather than a mass-consuming
thick plate. The septum is present in every generation of the Magazine
Cassette CAD as a consequence of this decision.

The sign convention in the Halbach array was one of the first errors found:
two sign errors in the analytic model, caught only by empirically probing a
simulated single array with magpylib (A24) rather than asserting the phase
convention was correct. `verify_field.py` exists because of this error.

---

### R5. Why the eddy-current brake, not regenerative arrest

The original arrest design credited regenerative braking, the same motor
would reverse and recover ~55% of the sled's kinetic energy back into the
supercapacitor bank. This was wrong.

Braking force is bounded by the same thrust constant as acceleration force.
Working backwards from the required arrest distance, motor-only braking at
rated current needs 1.2-2.6 m of track, more than exists. The correct
efficiency, once the false regeneration credit was removed, fell from 40% to
32% (A27). This was the most consequential error in the project because it
propagated into the paper's headline efficiency figure.

The eddy-current brake that replaced it is better suited to the application:

- Force is proportional to velocity, highest force appears earliest in the
  arrest stroke when velocity is highest. Right profile for rapid arrest.
- Contactless. The sled fin passes through the pole-plate field without
  touching anything. No wear, no single-point failure from contact
  degradation over 12 shots per campaign.
- Flight heritage in the eddy-current damper class (solar arrays, antenna
  booms, attitude control mechanisms).

The brake authority turned out to be so large relative to the requirement
that the design constraint inverted: rather than sizing pole plates up for
sufficient force, the pole entry is *tapered* to cap peak deceleration near
200 g and protect the sintered NdFeB magnet bonds from shock. The 30 mm
taper entry length in `parameters.json` `brake.pole_taper_entry_length` is
a direct consequence of this inversion. This taper geometry is present in
every generation of the Brake CAD.

---

### R6. Why dual transverse cassettes

Four magazine architectures were compared and three were eliminated:

Revolver drum: ~40% volume waste at cylinder-to-rectangle corners.
Requires a rotary actuator and makes the drum a structural element that must
react magazine preload.

2-DOF conveying platform: requires a motor cell under every storage
position. Random access is pointless, deployment order is fixed at
integration and cannot change on orbit.

Tandem in-tube stack: geometrically impossible. The sled must return from
muzzle to breech between shots. A tandem stack in that volume blocks the
return path.

Dual transverse cassettes (adopted): cassettes flank the track laterally,
loading from the side. Sled return path remains clear. Magazine preload is
reacted by the cassette frame, not the track. The alternating port, starboard
feed pattern keeps lateral centre-of-mass asymmetry to one satellite pitch
at most, bounding the off-axis ejection force component that drives tip-off
torque. This is why `parameters.json` `magazine.satellites_per_cassette = 6`
and the assembly carries exactly two cassette instances.

---

### R7. Why the retention gate is separated from the release mechanism

During ascent, the satellite stack is held against launch vibration by a gate
that preloads the stack into the aft backstop. The key decision: this preload
path runs through structure, directly through the gate frame and cassette
shell, and never through the escapement mechanism that eventually releases
the satellite.

This was directly motivated by the NanoRacks ball-lock anomaly: ascent
preload ran *through* the release mechanism, and jack-screw torque above
0.11 N·m drove it toward seizure. VOLLEY routes that load away from the
release path entirely. The escapement is caged during ascent and sees launch
loads never. This makes the NanoRacks failure mode geometrically impossible.

Consequence in the CAD: the gate frame is a dedicated structural body in the
Magazine Cassette. The two D6 A-286 shear pins (`parameters.json`
`magazine.gate_pin_material = "A-286"`, `gate_pin_count = 2`) at x = 110 mm
and x = 290 mm carry the 5,900 N ascent preload at a margin of 1.2 (A36).
These pins appear in the Magazine Cassette from Gen2 onward, they are
absent in Gen1, which is one of Gen1's documented defects.

---

### R8. Why the coast-and-trim release zone and the x = 1500 mm release point

If the satellite were released at peak motor force, the tip-off torque would
be dominated by the gradient of the Halbach force field over the satellite's
length. A rough calculation puts the leading term above 30°/s against a
requirement of less than 5°/s derived from NRCSD-E flown deployer
performance.

The coast-and-trim zone reduces this: after main acceleration the servo
drives to target velocity and coasts with near-zero force. Release happens
in this coast phase, when electromagnetic force on the satellite is
negligible. The release point at x = 1,500 mm in `parameters.json`
`track.release_point` is the start of this zone. The track runs to 1,800 mm
and the brake occupies x = 1,530-1,740 mm, both beyond the release point,
the sled runs on into the brake *after* the payload departs.

This layout also defines the abort logic: up to ~45% of stroke (~13.5 m/s)
the servo can decelerate the sled and return it to home within the available
track length. Past that the shot is committed. The three-inhibit no-fire
chain must be green before the trigger fires precisely because mid-stroke
abort is a contingency, not a load-bearing safety feature.

---

### R9. Why the ESPA interface and host-agnostic framing

The original design was written around ISRO POEM as a specific host.
Reframing to host-agnostic happened in 2026-07: the deployer is now
specified against a generic four-item interface, a secondary-payload mount
(ESPA-class bolt pattern), a 150-300 W electrical allotment, an attitude
reference able to absorb 81.5 N·s per shot, and a disposal path for the
host stage.

The ESPA Grande ring flange (Ø460 mm OD, Ø400 mm bolt circle, 24x M9 bolts,
25 mm thick) in `parameters.json` `interface_espa` is the reference
interface because it is the most widely flown secondary-payload standard in
the mass class VOLLEY targets.

Open conflict P9 (unresolved as of Gen3): the closed installed envelope
is 1,839x 530x 940 mm. ESPA Grande's longest-dimension class limit is
~1,270 mm. VOLLEY exceeds it by ~44% because the brake lives past the 1,500
mm release point and the enclosure spans it. This cannot be resolved in CAD
without a ConOps decision. The paper claims ESPA-Grande-class compatibility
that claim is contradicted by the CAD. This is documented as P12 in
`OPEN_PROBLEMS.md`.

---

### R10. Why the enclosure is the ninth document and why mass is incomplete

The enclosure is the last of the nine documents to be built. It represents
the flight unit as seen from outside: 2 mm aluminium skins, muzzle panel
with a 160x160 mm aperture, aft horseshoe cutout for the ESPA flange,
1,600x200x3 mm radiator at z = 707 mm, and four equipment bays (96 V / 6 F
supercapacitor bank, SiC inverter, avionics sequencer, IMU).

Its mass is absent from `analysis/mass_properties.py`. The 72.3 kg
dry-mass figure in the paper and README is therefore incomplete (open
problem P10). The mass was deferred to avoid adding plausible-sounding
numbers without methodology. The correct fix is to estimate each bay's mass
from geometry and material density, flag it `ESTIMATED_PENDING_VENDOR`, and
add it to `mass_properties.py`.

## PART II: GENERATION CHANGE LOG

---

## GEN 1: OG CAD

Date range: 2021-2025 (exact build history not reconstructed)
Fusion hub folder: `OG CAD` to renamed `Gen1` on 2026-07-28
STEP exports: 11 files in `EMOCD_figs/Gen1/`
Status: SUPERSEDED. Retained as design heritage and geometric ancestor
reference only. Do not cite Gen1 dimensions without cross-checking against
`cad/parameters.json`.

### What Gen1 is

Gen1 is the original set of Fusion 360 documents built to establish the
physical envelope and structural concept of VOLLEY. It is the first complete
3D realisation of the system and is the geometric source from which
`EMOCD-main/cad/parameters.json` was reverse-engineered by direct read of
the live Fusion model on 2026-07-23 (`parameters.json` `_PROVENANCE`
section, method: "Rebuilt by reading the nine-document Autodesk Fusion model
directly").

Gen1 is therefore the geometric ancestor of the entire parameter set.
However, it does not faithfully represent the current design in several
areas: it reflects design decisions that were later reversed, and several
sub-systems were built as structural proxies rather than detailed mechanism
models.

## GEN 2: First Structured Revision

Date range: 2025-2026-07 (built iteratively; exact commit dates not
reconstructed)
Fusion hub folder: `Fresh` to renamed `Gen2` on 2026-07-28
STEP exports: 9 files in `EMOCD_figs/Gen2/`
Status: SUPERSEDED by Gen3. Retained as intermediate reference showing
the transition from structural proxy models to mechanism-level detail.

### What Gen2 is

Gen2 is the first structured revision of the VOLLEY CAD, built after the
coilgun-to-LSM decision was finalised and after `cad/parameters.json` was
established as the governing source of truth. All nine documents were built
as separate Fusion files from the outset, each corresponding to one row in
`parameters.json` `documents`.

Gen2 corrected the major structural proxy issues in Gen1, sled mechanism
completeness, stator layer count, magazine mechanism detail, brake ring
spring stop. It is the first generation that can be called a mechanism-level
model rather than a structural envelope. The `_FRESH` suffix used during
build was informal, it meant "freshly built from parameters" as opposed to
the legacy organic Gen1 geometry. Renamed `_Gen2` on 2026-07-28.

Gen2 did not resolve all defects. Several parameter mismatches carried
forward from Gen1 (longeron overall width, brake local-origin placement,
sled sketch parametric driving) and were only corrected in Gen3. The
assembly in Gen2 still had zero joints, carrying G1-D6 forward.

### Gen2 file inventory (verified by direct Fusion API read, 2026-07-28)

| File | STEP size | Bodies read | Key geometry | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `EMOCD_Track_Gen2.step` | 35,670 bytes | 4 | Longerons 1800x45x65 mm; 2x launch locks | Longerons at correct 1800 mm length. Width grown to 45 mm (vs 20 mm in Gen1), wider web section. No roller channels or guide flanges yet. File is smaller than Gen1 Track despite more detail, different sketch approach |
| `EMOCD_Stator_Gen2.step` | 967,482 bytes | 162 | Conductors 7x90x10 mm | Single-layer, 162 conductors: corrects G1-D2. Belt sequence A+/C−/B+/A−/C+/B− with phase labelling per conductor. STEP file approximately halved in size vs Gen1 (967 KB vs 1.95 MB) reflecting the single-layer correction |
| `EMOCD_Sled_Gen2.step` | 80,554 bytes | 16 | Chassis plates 360x110x6 mm; Halbach arrays upper/lower 340x90x8 mm; 4x rollers 30x16x30 mm (Ø30 mm); 4x roller arms; brake fin 120x80x4 mm | Mechanism-level sled: corrects G1-D1. Halbach arrays, rollers, roller arms, and brake fin all present. However: chassis length is 360 mm (should be 488 mm per parameters.json) and width is 110 mm (should be 140 mm).

## GEN 3: Parameter-Reconciled Revision

Date range: 2026-07 (built during the 2026-07-23 CAD build session and
subsequent corrections applied 2026-07-28)
Fusion hub folder: `Even more fresh` to renamed `Gen3` on 2026-07-28
STEP exports: 10 files in `EMOCD_figs/Gen3/` (9 component files + 1
monolithic single-file model `EMOCD_Gen3.step`)
Status: CURRENT. This is the generation against which open problems P5, P12 are indexed. All geometry values carry status from `parameters.json`.

### What Gen3 is

Gen3 is the parameter-reconciled revision of the VOLLEY CAD. It was built
during the 2026-07-23 CAD build session documented in the `EMOCD_CAD_Master_Plan.md`
working document, which performed a live read of the Fusion hub via the
Fusion MCP and rebuilt the parameter set from the actual geometry. This is
the build that produced the current `cad/parameters.json`.

Gen3 introduced two things that did not exist in any earlier generation:

1. The `EMOCD_Gen3.step` monolithic model (2,520,630 bytes), a
   single Fusion document (`EMOCD_Gen3`, previously named `VOLLEY but really
   detailed`) that contains all nine sub-systems as components within one
   assembly file. This is the most detailed single-file representation of
   the system and is the model used for the CAD renders in `EMOCD-main/cad/renders/`.

2. The first assembly with joint definitions, the Gen3 assembly has 8
   structural components grounded (`isGrounded = True`: Track, Stator, both
   Cassettes, both Brake instances, Interface ESPA, Enclosure) and a sled
   slider as-built joint defining X-axis travel with limits 0-1740 mm. Gen1
   and Gen2 assemblies had zero joints.

Gen3 also corrected all dimensional defects identified in Gen2 (sled length,
sled width, brake position) and corrected the user parameters in the
monolithic model that were previously not propagating to geometry.

### Gen3 file inventory (verified by direct Fusion API read, 2026-07-28)

| File | STEP size | Bodies read | Key geometry | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `EMOCD_Track_Gen3.step` | 35,241 bytes | 4 | Longerons 1800x45x65 mm; 2x launch locks | Longerons at correct 1800 mm length. Same structure as Gen2 Track. No roller channels, G2-D7 not resolved |
| `EMOCD_Stator_Gen3.step` | 967,476 bytes | 162 | Conductors 7x90x10 mm | Single-layer 162 conductors with phase labelling, same as Gen2. Correct per spec. File size within 6 bytes of Gen2 Stator (967,476 vs 967,482), effectively identical geometry |

Chassis length 488 mm (was 360 mm in Gen2) and width 140 mm (was 110 mm in Gen2) now match `parameters.json` `sled.overall_length` and `sled.overall_width`. Achieved by remapping sketch point geometry and forcing design.computeAll(). Roller diameter 30 mm correct throughout Gen2 and Gen3 |
| `EMOCD_Magazine_Cassette_Gen3.step` | 131,320 bytes | 24 | Shell 380.5x140x640 mm; full mechanism | Same mechanism completeness as Gen2 (24 bodies). Cassette height still 640 mm (G2-D3 not resolved in Gen3. File 929 bytes smaller than Gen2) minor geometry refinement |

| `EMOCD_Assembly_Gen3.step` | 1,433,418 bytes | 21 occurrences | Full assembly with joints | First assembly with kinematic joints: corrects G1-D6 / G2-D6. 8 structural components grounded, sled slider as-built joint with X-axis limits 0-1740 mm. 12 payloads (6 per cassette), 2x cassette instances, 2x brake instances. File 10 bytes smaller than Gen2 Assembly, effectively identical geometry, the joint definitions are not reflected in STEP size |
| `EMOCD_Gen3.step` | 2,520,630 bytes | 9 sub-components, all bodies | Monolithic single-file assembly with all 9 sub-systems | Unique to Gen3. The `VOLLEY but really detailed` document renamed `EMOCD_Gen3`. Contains Track (43 bodies), Stator (170 bodies including 162 conductors + spine + brackets), Sled (76 bodies including 56 Halbach magnets + chassis + 8 rollers + brake fin + detent latches), Payload (12 bodies, 12 CubeSat instances), Cassette_P (18 bodies), Cassette_S (18 bodies, corrected from 16 in earlier state by adding interface_pad_S5_0 and S5_1), Brake (8 bodies), Avionics (39 bodies including 32 supercap cells), Interface (9 bodies including bolt holes and gussets), Enclosure (7 bodies: 6 skins + radiator). Most complete single representation of VOLLEY in any generation |

## PART IV: OPEN PROBLEMS INDEXED TO CAD

The following open problems from `EMOCD-main/OPEN_PROBLEMS.md` have direct
CAD consequences. They are reproduced here for completeness so this file can
be read standalone. Described in full in `OPEN_PROBLEMS.md`.

| Problem | Description | CAD consequence | Status |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| P5 | CAD sled mass ~7.50 kg vs parametric assumption 4.86 kg | Exit velocity provisional at 17.88 m/s, not 20.37 m/s. No number in `analysis/*.py` changed. Sled chassis flagged `PROVISIONAL_PENDING_FEA` in `parameters.json` | Open. Requires ANSYS structural FEA (validation A4) |\n| P7 | Brake occupies x = 1530-1740 mm, beyond x = 1500 mm release point | Track and enclosure must extend past release, directly drives the 1839 mm total length and therefore P9 | Open. ConOps decision required |\n| P8 | Exit velocity provisionally 17.88 m/s if CAD sled mass holds | All downstream numbers (acceleration, efficiency, recoil, lifetime multiplier) shift. Not propagated into scripts or paper pending FEA | Open. Waiting on P5 resolution |\n| P9 | Installed envelope 1839 mm exceeds ESPA Grande ~1270 mm limit by ~44% | Machine cannot fit ESPA Grande as claimed. Host claim must be re-scoped or track repackaged | Open. Owner decision, cannot be resolved in code |\n| P10 | Enclosure, radiator, avionics absent from `mass_properties.py` | 72.3 kg dry-mass rollup is incomplete by an unknown amount | Open. Needs bay-by-bay mass estimation, then addition to `mass_properties.py` |\n| P11 | Whether P1, P4 corrections reached the submitted paper build is unconfirmed | `paper/archive/EMOCD_submission_uncorrected.pdf` still carries all four incorrect values. If this is the version of record, a corrigendum is needed, not a git commit | Open. Must confirm which build was submitted |\n| P12 | Paper claims ESPA-Grande-class envelope; CAD contradicts this by ~44% | Two places in paper.tex assert compatibility the geometry does not support. One is an abstract-level capability claim; the other is in the limitations section | Open. Entangled with P11, resolve P11 first, then fix paper.tex in one pass |\n| E1 | 3-D field end effects on Kt uncomputed | FEMM cross-section DXF and run sheet exist (`analysis/femm/`) but nothing has been run. A few percent on Kt unaccounted | Open. FEMM package written, not executed |\n| E2 | No FEA of any structural component | Sled, track, brake poles, cassette shell all first-pass geometry with no structural analysis behind them | Open. Validations A1 and A4 specified in `validation/` with pre-declared acceptance bands |\n| E3 | Enclosure, radiator, and avionics masses missing from rollup | Directly feeds P10 | Open |\n| E10 | Launch restraint drawn but not analysed | Retention gate pin sizing exists (two D6 A-286, margin 1.2, A36) and launch-lock blocks are in Track CAD but escapement caging, cam lock, and tolerance stack-up under vibration not analysed | Open, CAD advances this item from concept to drawn, not to analysed |\n\n---\n\n## PART V, FILE NAMING CONVENTION\n\nAll files across all generations follow the pattern:\n\n```\nEMOCD_[SubSystem]_[Generation].step\n```\n\nWhere `[SubSystem]` is one of:\n`Track`, `Stator`, `Sled`, `Magazine_Cassette`, `Brake`, `Interface_ESPA`,\n`Enclosure`, `Payload_3U`, `Assembly`\n\nAnd `[Generation]` is `Gen1`, `Gen2`, or `Gen3`.\n\nSpecial cases:\n- `EMOCD_Deployer_Assembly_Gen1.step` (legacy single-file model, Gen1 only,\n no repo counterpart. Superseded.\n- `EMOCD_Sled_Gen1b.step`) duplicate sled document from Gen1, later revision\n than `Sled_Gen1`. Suffix `b` added to disambiguate.\n- `EMOCD_Gen3.step`, monolithic single-file model, Gen3 only. Contains all\n nine sub-systems in one Fusion document. The most detailed and complete\n representation of VOLLEY in any generation.\n\n### Folder rename history\n\n| Original folder name | Renamed to | Date | Reason |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| `OG CAD` | `Gen1` | 2026-07-28 | Align with generation naming convention |\n| `Fresh` | `Gen2` | 2026-07-28 | `_FRESH` suffix meant \"built from parameters\", formalised as Gen2 |\n| `Even more fresh` | `Gen3` | 2026-07-28 | Formalised as Gen3 |\n\n---\n\n## PART VI, WHAT TO CHECK BEFORE USING ANY FILE\n\nBefore citing or using any geometry from `EMOCD_figs`:\n\n1. Use Gen3 files unless you specifically need a heritage comparison.\n Gen1 and Gen2 contain known dimensional and mechanism defects.\n\n2. Cross-check every dimension against `cad/parameters.json`.\n `parameters.json` is the source of truth, not the Fusion model. If they\n disagree, `parameters.json` wins and the CAD needs correcting.\n\n3. Do not quote Fusion-computed masses. The Fusion models use solid copper\n for the stator, solid aluminium for CubeSats, and steel standing in for\n NdFeB. None of these are the correct material densities. Mass authority\n is `analysis/mass_properties.py` only, and even that is incomplete (P10).\n\n4. The sled mass conflict is unresolved (P5/P8). The headline exit\n velocity of 20.37 m/s assumes a 4.86 kg sled. The Gen3 CAD sled geometry\n implies ~7.50 kg, which gives a provisional 17.88 m/s. Do not use either\n number without noting this conflict until ANSYS structural FEA (A4)\n resolves it.\n\n5. The ESPA envelope claim is not supported by the CAD (P9/P12). The\n installed length of 1839 mm exceeds ESPA Grande's ~1270 mm limit by ~44%.\n Do not present VOLLEY as ESPA-Grande-compatible without noting this open\n problem.\n\n6. The stator layer count is still an open design decision. Gen1 built\n two layers; Gen2 and Gen3 built one layer; `parameters.json` explicitly\n flags the decision as open. The electromagnetic consequence (roughly x2\n on force for the same current, but also x2 on copper mass and winding\n complexity) has not been computed for the two-layer case.\n\n---\n\n*End of CHANGELOG_CAD. Append new entries below this line.*\n```
